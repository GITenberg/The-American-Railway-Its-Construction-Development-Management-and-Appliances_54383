<h2><a href="#CONTENTS">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

<p class="pfs90 smcap">By THOMAS M. COOLEY.</p>

<div class="large">
<p>The railroads of the United States, now aggregating a
hundred and fifty thousand miles and having several hundred
different managements, are frequently spoken of comprehensively
as the railroad system of the country, as
though they constituted a unity in fact, and might be regarded
and dealt with as an entirety, by their patrons and
by the public authorities, whenever the conveniences they
are expected to supply, or the conduct of managers and
agents, come in question. So far, however, is this from being
the case, that it would be impossible to name any other industrial
interest where the diversities are so obvious and
the want of unity so conspicuous and so important. The diversities
date from the very origin of the roads; they have
not come into existence under the same laws nor subject to
the same control. It was accepted as an undoubted truth in
constitutional law from the first that the authority for the
construction of railroads within a State must come from the
State itself, which alone could empower the promoters to
appropriate lands by adversary proceedings for the purpose.
The grant of corporate power must also come from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
the State, or, at least, have State recognition and sanction;
and where the proposed road was to cross a State boundary,
the necessary corporate authority must be given by every
State through or into which the road was to run. It was
conceded that the delegated powers of the General Government
did not comprehend the granting of charters for the
construction of these roads within the States, and even in
the Territories charters were granted by the local legislatures.
The case of the transcontinental roads was clearly
exceptional; they were to be constructed in large part over
the public domain, and subsidies were to be granted by
Congress for the purpose. They were also, in part at least,
to be constructed for governmental reasons as national
agencies; and invoking State authority for the purpose
seemed to be as inconsistent as it would be inadequate.
But, though these were exceptional cases, the magnitude
and importance of the Pacific roads are so immense that
the agency of the General Government in making provision
for this method of transportation must always have prominence
in railroad history and railroad statistics.</p>

<p>Not only have the roads been diverse in origin, but the
corporations which have constructed them have differed
very greatly in respect to their powers and rights, and also
to the obligations imposed by law upon them. The early
grants of power were charter-contracts, freely given, with
very liberal provisions; the public being more anxious that
they be accepted and acted upon than distrustful of their
abuse afterward. Many of them were not subject to alteration
or repeal, except with the consent of the corporators;
and some of them contained provisions intended to exclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
or limit competition, so that, within a limited territory, something
in the nature of a monopoly in transportation would
be created. The later grants give evidence of popular apprehension
of corporate abuses; the legislature reserves a
control over them, and the right to multiply railroads indefinitely
is made as free as possible, under the supposition
that in this multiplication is to be found the best protection
against any one of them abusing its powers. In very many
cases the motive to the building of a new road has been
antagonism to one already in existence, and municipalities
have voted subsidies to the one in the hope that, when constructed,
it would draw business away from the other. The
anomaly has thus been witnessed of distrust of corporate
power being the motive for increasing it; and the multiplication
of roads has gone on, without any general supervision
or any previous determination by competent public authority
that they were needed, until the increase has quite outrun
in some sections any proper demand for their facilities.</p>

<p>Roads thus brought into existence, without system and
under diverse managements, it was soon seen were capable
of being so operated that the antagonism of managers,
instead of finding expression in legitimate competition,
would be given to the sort of strife that can only be properly
characterized by calling it, as it commonly is called, a
war. From such a war the public inevitably suffers. The
best service upon the roads is only performed when they
are operated as if they constituted in fact parts of one harmonious
system; the rates being made by agreement, and
traffic exchanged with as little disturbance as possible, and
without abrupt break at the terminals. But when every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
management might act independently, it sometimes happened
that a company made its method of doing business
an impediment instead of a help to the business done over
other roads, recognizing no public duty which should preclude
its doing so, provided a gain to itself, however indirect
or illegitimate, was probable. Many consolidations
of roads have had for their motive the getting rid of this
power to do mischief on the part of roads absorbed.</p>

<p>In nothing is the want of unity so distinctly and mischievously
obvious as in the power of each corporation to
make rates independently. It may not only make its own
local rates at discretion, but it may join or refuse to join
with others in making through rates; so that an inconsiderable
and otherwise insignificant road may be capable of
being so used as to throw rates for a large section of the
country into confusion, and to render the making of profit
by other roads impossible. It is frequently said in railroad
circles that roads are sometimes constructed for no other
reason than because, through this power of mischief, it will
be possible to levy contributions upon others, or to compel
others, in self-protection, to buy them up at extravagant
prices. Cases are named in which this sort of scheming is
supposed to have succeeded, and others in which it is now
being tried.</p>

<p>Evils springing from the diversities mentioned have
been cured, or greatly mitigated, by such devices as the
formation of fast-freight lines to operate over many roads;
by allowing express companies to come upon the roads
with semi-independence in the transportation of articles,
where, for special reasons, the public is content to pay an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
extra price for extra care or speed; and by arrangements
with sleeping-car companies for special accommodations in
luxurious cars to those desiring them. These collateral
arrangements, however, have not been wholly beneficial;
and had all the roads been constructed as parts of one system
and under one management, some of them would
neither have been necessary nor defensible. They exist
now, however, with more or less reason for their existence;
and they tend to increase the diversities in railroad
work.</p>

<p>The want of unity which has been pointed out tended
to breed abuses specially injurious to the public, and governmental
regulation was entered upon for their correction.
Naturally the first attempts in this direction were made
by separate States, each undertaking to regulate for itself
the transportation within its own limits. Such regulation
would have been perfectly logical, and perhaps effectual,
had the roads within each State formed a system by themselves;
but when State boundaries had very little importance,
either to the roads themselves or to the traffic done
over them, unless made important by restrictive and obstructive
legislation, the regulation by any State must necessarily
be fragmentary and imperfect, and diverse regulation
in different States might be harmful rather than
beneficial. It must be said for State regulation that it has
in general been exercised in a prudent and conservative
way, but it is liable to be influenced by a sensitive and excitable
public opinion; and as nothing is more common
than to find gross abuses in the matter of railroad transportation
selfishly defended in localities, and even in consid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>erable
sections, which are supposed to receive benefits from
them, it would not be strange if the like selfishness should
sometimes succeed in influencing the exercise of power
by one State in a manner that a neighboring State would
regard as unfriendly and injurious.</p>

<p>The Federal Government recently undertook the work of
regulation, and in doing so accepted the view upon which
the States had acted, and so worded its statute that the
transportation which does not cross State lines is supposed
to be excluded. The United States thus undertakes to
regulate interstate commerce by rail, and the States regulate,
or may regulate, that which is not interstate. It was
perhaps overlooked at first that, inasmuch as Government
control may embrace the making of classifications, prescribing
safety and other appliances, and naming rates, any considerable
regulation of State traffic and interstate traffic separately
must necessarily to some extent cause interference.
The two classes of traffic flow on together over the same
lines in the same vehicles under the management of the
same agencies, with little or no distinction based on State
lines; the rates and the management influenced by considerations
which necessarily are of general force, so that separate
regulation may without much extravagance be compared
to an attempt in the case of one of our great rivers to
regulate the flow of the waters in general, but without, in
doing so, interfering with an independent regulation of
such portion thereof as may have come from the springs
and streams of some particular section. This is one of
many reasons for looking upon all existing legislation as
merely tentative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span></p>

<p>No doubt the time will come when the railroads of the
country will constitute, as they do not now, a system.
There are those who think this may, sufficiently for practical
purposes, be accomplished by the legalization of some
scheme of pooling; but this is a crude device, against which
there is an existing prejudice not easily to be removed.
Others look for unity through gradual consolidations, the
tendency to which is manifest, or through something in the
nature of a trust, or by means of more comprehensive and
stringent national control. Beyond all these is not infrequently
suggested a Government ownership.</p>

<p>Of the theories that might be advanced in this direction,
or the arguments in their support, nothing further will be
said here; the immediate purpose being accomplished
when it is shown how misleading may be the term <em>system</em>,
when applied to the railroads of the country as an aggregate,
as now owned, managed, and controlled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Every man in the land is interested daily and constantly
in railroads and the transportation of persons and
property over them. The price of whatever he eats, or
wears, or uses, the cost and comfort of travel, the speed
and convenience with which he shall receive his mail and
the current intelligence of the day, and even the intimacy
and extent of his social relations, are all largely affected
thereby. The business employs great numbers of persons,
and the wages paid them affect largely the wages paid in
other lines of occupation. The management of the business
in some of its departments is attended by serious dangers,
and thousands annually lose their lives in the service.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
Other thousands annually are either killed or injured in
being transported; the aggregate being somewhat startling,
though unquestionably this method of travel is safer
than any other. The ingenuity which has been expended
in devices to make the transportation rapid, cheap, and
safe may well be characterized as marvellous, and some
feats in railroad engineering are the wonder of the world.
With all these facts and many others to create a public interest
in the general subject, the editor of <cite>Scribner's Magazine</cite>,
some little time ago, applied to writers of well-known
ability and competency to prepare papers for publication
therein upon the various topics of principal interest in the
life and use of railroads, beginning with the construction,
and embracing the salient facts of management and
service. He was successful in securing a series of papers
of high value, the appearance of which has been welcomed
from month to month, beginning with June, 1888, with constant
and increasing interest. These papers have a permanent
value; and, in obedience to a demand for their separate
publication in convenient form for frequent reference,
the publishers now reproduce them with expansions and
additions. A reference to the several titles will convince
anyone at all familiar with the general subject that the
particular topic is treated in every instance by an expert,
entitled as such to speak with authority.</p>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_001dc.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="p4 drop-cap">The world of to-day differs from that of Napoleon
Bonaparte more than his world differed
from that of Julius Cæsar; and this change has
chiefly been made by railways.</p>

<p>Railways have been known since the days
of the Romans. Their tracks were made of two
lines of cut stones. Iron rails took their place about one hundred
and fifty years ago, when the use of that metal became extended.
These roads were called tram-roads, and were used to carry coal
from the mines to the places of shipment. They were few in number
and attracted little attention.</p>

<p>The modern railway was created by the Stephensons in 1830,
when they built the locomotive "Rocket." The development of
the railway since is due to the development of the locomotive.
Civil engineering has done much, but mechanical engineering has
done more.</p>

<p>The invention of the steam-engine by James Watt, in 1773,
attracted the attention of advanced thinkers to a possible steam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
locomotive. Erasmus Darwin, in a poem published in 1781, made
this remarkable prediction:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Soon shall thy arm, unconquered steam! afar</p>
<p class="verse">Drag the slow barge, or drive the rapid car."</p>
</div></div>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_002.jpg" width="275" alt="" />
<div class="caption">First Locomotive.</div>
</div>

<p>The first locomotive of which we have any certain record was
invented, and put in operation on a model circular railway in
London, in 1804, by Richard Trevithick,
an erratic genius, who invented
many things but perfected
few. His locomotive could not
make steam, and therefore could
neither go fast nor draw a heavy
load. This was the fault of all its
successors, until the competitive
trial of locomotives on the Liverpool
and Manchester Railway, in
1829. The Stephensons, father and son, had invented the steam
blast, which, by constantly blowing the fire, enabled the "Rocket,"
with its tubular boiler, to make steam enough to draw ten passenger
cars, at the rate of thirty-five miles an hour.</p>

<p>Then was born the modern giant, and so recent is the date of
his birth that one of the unsuccessful competitors at that memorable
trial, Captain John Ericsson, was until the present year
(1889) living and actively working in New York. Another engineer,
Horatio Allen, who drove the first locomotive on the first
trip ever made in the United States, in 1831, still lives, a hale
and hearty old man, near New York.</p>

<p>The earlier locomotives of this country, modelled after the
"Rocket," weighed five or six tons, and could draw, on a level,
about 40 tons. After the American improvements, which we
shall describe, were made, our engines weighed 25 tons, and
could draw, on a level, some sixty loaded freight cars, weighing
1,200 tons. This was a wonderful advance, but now we have the
"Consolidation" locomotive, weighing 50 tons, and able to draw,
on a level, a little over 2,400 tons.</p>

<p>And this is not the end. Still heavier and more powerful
engines are being designed and built, but the limit of the strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of the track, according to its present forms, has nearly been
reached. It is very certain we have not reached the limit of the
size and power of engines, or the strength of the track that can
be devised.</p>

<p>After the success of the "Rocket," and of the Liverpool and
Manchester Railway, the authority of George Stephenson and his
son Robert became absolute and unquestioned upon all subjects
of railway engineering. Their locomotives had very little side
play to their wheels, and could not go around sharp curves.
They accordingly preferred to make their lines as straight as possible,
and were willing to spend vast sums to get easy grades.
Their lines were taken as models and imitated by other engineers.
All lines in England were made with easy grades and gentle
curves. Monumental bridges, lofty stone viaducts, and deep cuts
or tunnels at every hill marked this stage of railway construction
in England, which was imitated on the European lines.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_003.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Locomotive of To-day.</div>
</div>

<p>As it was with the railway, so it was with the locomotive.
The Stephenson type, once fixed, has remained unchanged (in
Europe), except in detail, to the present day. European locomotives
have increased in weight and power, and in perfection of
material and workmanship, but the general features are those
of the locomotives built by the great firm of George Stephenson
&amp; Son, before 1840.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When we come to the United States we find an entirely different
state of things. The key to the evolution of the American
railway is the contempt for authority displayed by our engineers,
and the untrammelled way in which they invented and applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
whatever they thought would answer the best purpose, regardless
of precedent. When we began to build our railways, in 1831,
we followed English patterns for a short time. Our engineers
soon saw that unless vital changes were made our money would
not hold out, and our railway system would be very short. Necessity
truly became the mother of invention.</p>

<p>The first, and most far-reaching, invention was that of the
swivelling truck, which, placed under the front end of an engine,
enables it to run around curves of almost any radius. This
enabled us to build much less expensive lines than those of England,
for we could now curve around and avoid hills and other
obstacles at will. The illustration opposite shows a railroad curving
around a mountain and supported by a retaining wall, instead
of piercing through the mountain with a tunnel, as would
have been necessary but for the swivelling truck. The swivelling
truck was first suggested by Horatio Allen, for the South Carolina
Railway, in 1831; but the first practical use of it was made on the
Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, in the same year. It is said to
have been invented by John B. Jervis, Chief Engineer of that
road.</p>

<p>The next improvement was the invention of the equalizing
beams or levers, by which the weight of the engine is always
borne by three out of four or more driving-wheels. They act like
a three-legged stool, which can always be set level on any irregular
spot. The original imported English locomotives could not
be kept on the rails of rough tracks. The same experience obtained
in Canada when the Grand Trunk Railway was opened, in
1854&ndash;55. The locomotives of English pattern constantly ran off
the track; those of American pattern hardly ever did so. Finally,
all their locomotives were changed by having swivelling trucks
put under their forward ends, and no more trouble occurred. The
equalizing levers were patented in 1838, by Joseph Harrison, Jr.,
of Philadelphia.</p>

<div class="caption">Alpine Pass. Avoidance of a Tunnel.</div>
</div>

<p>These two improvements, which are absolutely essential to the
success of railways in new countries, and have been adopted in
Canada, Australia, Mexico, and South America,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to the exclusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of English patterns, are also of great value on the smoothest and
best possible tracks. The flexibility of the American machine increases
its adhesion and enables it to draw greater loads than its
English rival. The same flexibility equalizes its pressure on the
track, prevents shocks and blows, and enables it to keep out of
the hospital and run more miles in a year than an English locomotive.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="caption">A Sharp Curve&mdash;Manhattan Elevated Railway, 110th Street, New York.</div>
</div>

<p>Equally valuable improvements were made in cars, both for
passengers and freight. Instead of the four-wheeled English car,
which on a rough track dances along on three wheels, we owe
to Ross Winans, of Baltimore, the application of a pair of four-wheeled
swivelling trucks, one under each end of the car, thus enabling
it to accommodate itself to the inequalities of a rough track
and to follow its locomotive around the sharpest curves. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
are, on our main lines, curves
of less than 300 feet radius,
while, on the Manhattan Elevated,
the largest passenger
traffic in the world is conducted
around curves of less than
100 feet radius. There are
few curves of less than 1,000
feet radius on European railways.</p>

<div class="center caption">A steep grade on a<br />Mountain Railroad.</div>

<p>The climbing capabilities of
a locomotive upon smooth rails
were not known until, in 1852, Mr. B. H. Latrobe, Chief Engineer
of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, tried a temporary zigzag gradient
of 10 per cent.&mdash;that is 10 feet rise in 100 feet length, or 528
feet per mile&mdash;over a hill about two miles long, through which the
Kingwood Tunnel was being excavated. A locomotive weighing
28 tons on its drivers took one car weighing 15 tons over this line
in safety. It was worked for passenger traffic for six months.
This daring feat has never been equalled. Trains go over 4 per
cent. gradients on the Colorado system, and there is one short
line, used to bring ore to the Pueblo furnaces, which is worked by
locomotives over a 7 per cent. grade. These are believed to be
the steepest grades worked by ordinary locomotives on smooth
rails.</p>

    rails.</p>
    </div>

<p>Another American invention is the switchback. By this plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the length of line required to ease the gradient is obtained by running
backward and forward in a zigzag course, instead of going
straight up the mountain. As a full stop has to be made at the
end of every piece of line, there is no danger of the train running
away from its brakes. This device was first used among the hills
of Pennsylvania over forty years ago, to lower coal cars down into
the Nesquehoning Valley. It was afterwards used on the Callao,
Lima, and Oroya Railroad in Peru, by American engineers, with
extraordinary daring and skill. It was employed to carry the
temporary tracks of the Cascade Division of the Northern Pacific
Railroad over the "Stampede" Pass, with grades of 297 feet per
mile, while a tunnel 9,850 feet long was being driven through the
mountains.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_009.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A Switchback.</div>
</div>

<p>With the improvement of brakes and more reliable means of
stopping trains upon steep grades, came a farther development of
the above device, which was first applied on the Denver and Rio
Grande Railroad in Colorado, and has since been applied on a
grand scale on the Saint Gothard road, the Black Forest railways
of Germany, and the Semmering line in the Tyrol. This device is
to connect the two lines of the zigzag by a curve at the point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
where they come together, so that the train, instead of going alternately
backward and forward, now runs continuously on. It
becomes possible for the line to return above itself in spiral form,
sometimes crossing over the lower level by a tunnel, and sometimes
by a bridge. A notable instance of this kind of location is
seen on the Tehachapi Pass of the Southern Pacific, where the line
ascends 2,674
feet in 25 miles,
with eleven tunnels,
and a spiral
3,800 feet
long.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_010a.jpg" width="450" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Plan of Big Loop.</div>
</div>

<p>The "Big Loop," as it is called, on the Georgetown branch of
the Union Pacific, in Colorado, between Georgetown and a mining
camp called Silver Plume, has been chosen to illustrate this point.
The direct distance up the valley is 1¼ miles and the elevation 600
feet, requiring a gradient of 480 feet per mile. But by curving the
line around in a spiral, the length of the line is increased to 4 miles
and the gradient reduced to 150 feet per mile. Zigzags were used
first for foot-paths, then for common roads, lastly for railways.
Their natural sequence, spirals, was a railway device entirely, and
confirms the saying of one of our engineers: "Where a mule can
go, I can make a locomotive go." This may be called the poetry
of engineering,
as it requires
both imagination
to conceive
and skill to execute.</p>

<div class="caption">Profile of the Same.</div>
</div>

<p>There is one
thing more
which distinguishes
the American railway from its English parent, and that is
the almost uniform practice of getting the road open for traffic in
the cheapest manner and in the least possible time, and then completing
it and enlarging its capacity out of its surplus earnings, and
from the credit which these earnings give it.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania Railroad between Philadelphia and Harrisburg
is a notable example of this. Within the past few years it has
been rebuilt on a grand scale, and in many places relocated, and
miles of sharp curves and heavy gradients, originally put in to save
expense, have been taken out. This system has been followed
everywhere, except on a few branch lines, and upon one monumental
example of failure&mdash;the West Shore Railroad, of New York.
The projectors of that line attempted in three years to build a
double-track railroad up to the standard of the Pennsylvania road,
which had been forty years in reaching its present excellence.
Their money gave out, and they came to grief.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>We have thus briefly reviewed the development of our railways
to show what they are, and how they came to be what they are,
before describing the processes of building, in order that the
reasons may be clearly understood why we do certain things, and
why we fail to do other things which we ought to do.</p>

<p>In the building of a railway the first thing is to make the surveys
and locate the position of the intended road upon the ground,
and to make maps and sections of it, so that the land may be
bought and the estimates of cost be ascertained. The engineer's
first duty is to make a survey by eye without the aid of instruments.
This is called the "reconnoissance." By this he lays down the
general position of the line, and where he wants it to go if possible.
Great skill, the result of long experience, or equally great
ignorance may be shown here. After the general position of the
line, or some part of it, has been laid down upon the pocket map,
the engineer sends his party into the field to make the preliminary
survey with instruments.</p>

<p>In an old-settled country the party may live in farm-houses and
taverns, and be carried to their daily work by teams. But a surveying
party will make better progress, be healthier and happier, if
they live in their own home, even if that home be a travelling camp
of a few tents. With a competent commissary the camp can be
well supplied with provisions, and be pitched near enough to the
probable end of the day's work to save the tired men a long walk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
When they get to camp and, after a wash in the nearest creek,
find a smoking-hot supper ready&mdash;even though it consist of fried
pork and potatoes, corn-bread and black coffee&mdash;their troubles are
all forgotten, and they feel a true satisfaction which the flesh-pots
of Delmonico's cannot give. One greater pleasure remains&mdash;to
fill the old pipe, and recline by the camp-fire for a jolly smoke.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_014.jpg" width="625" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Engineers in Camp.</div>
</div>

<p>A full surveying party consists of the front flag-man, with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
corps of axe-men to cut away trees and bushes; the transit-man,
who records the distances and angles of the line, assisted by his
chain-men and flag-men; and lastly the leveller, who takes and
records the levels, with his rod-men and axe-men. The chief of
the party exercises a general supervision over all, and is sometimes
assisted by a topographer, who sketches in his book the
contours of the hills and direction and size of the watercourses.</p>

<p>One tent contains the cook, the commissary, and the provisions;
another tent or two the working party, and another the superior
engineers, with their drawing instruments and boards. In a
properly regulated party the map and profile of the day's work
should be plotted before going to bed, so as to see if all is right.
If it turns out that the line can be improved and easier grades got,
or other changes made, now is the time to do it.</p>

<p>After the preliminary lines have been run, the engineer-in-chief
takes up the different maps and lays down a new line, sometimes
coinciding with that surveyed, and sometimes quite different. The
parties then go back into the field and stake out this new line,
called the "approximate location," upon which the curves are all
run in. In difficult country the line may be run over even a third
or fourth time; or in an easy country, the "preliminary" surveys
may be all that is wanted.</p>

<p>The life of an engineer, while making surveys, is not an easy
one. His duties require the physical strength of a drayman and
the mental accuracy of a professor, both exerted at the same time,
and during heat and cold, rain and shine.</p>

<p>An engineer, once on a time, standing behind his instrument,
was surrounded by a crowd of natives, anxious to know all about
it. He explained his processes, using many learned words, and
flattered himself that he had made a deep impression upon his
hearers. At last, one old woman spoke up, with an expression of
great contempt on her face, "Wall! If I knowed as much as you
do, I'd quit ingineerin' and keep a grocery!"</p>

<p>A large part of the financial difficulties of our railways results
from not taking time enough to properly locate the line. It must
be remembered that a cheaply constructed line can be rebuilt, but
with a badly located line nothing can be done except to abandon
it entirely.</p>

<p>It is well therefore to consider carefully what is the true problem
of location. It is so to place and build a line of railway that it
shall get the greatest amount of business out of the country through
which it passes, and at the same time be able to do that business
at the least cost, including both expenses of operating and the
fixed charges on the capital invested. The mere statement of this
problem shows that it is not an easy one. Its solution is different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
in a new and unsettled country from that in an old-settled region.
In the new country, the shortest, cheapest, and straightest
line possible, consistent with the easiest gradients that the topography
of the land will allow, is the
best. The towns will spring up after
the road is built, and will be built on
its line, and generally at the places where stations have been fixed.</p>

<p>In a mountainous country, like Colorado, the problem is how
to reach the important mining camps, regardless of the crookedness
and increased length given to the line. The Denver and
Rio Grande has been compared to an octopus. This is really a
compliment to its engineers. It sucks nutriment from every place
where nutriment is to be found. To do this it has been forced to
climb mountains, where it was thought locomotives could never
climb. In one place, called the Royal Gorge, the difficulties of
blasting a road-bed into the side of the mountain were so great that
it was thought expedient to carry the track upon a bridge, and
this bridge was hung from two rafters, braced against the sides of
the gorge. In surveying some parts of the lines the engineers
were suspended by ropes from the top of the mountains and made
their measurements swinging in mid-air.</p>

<p>The problem of location is different in an old-settled country,
where the position of the towns as trade-centres has been fixed by
natural laws that cannot be overruled. In this case the best thing
the engineer can do is to get the easiest gradient possible consist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>ent
with the topography of the country, and let the curves take
care of themselves; always to strike the important towns, even if
the line is made more crooked and longer thereby; to so place
the line in these towns as to accommodate the public, and
still be able to buy plenty of land; also to locate
for under or over, rather than grade crossings.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_018b.jpg" width="350" alt="" />

<p>In all countries, old and new, mountainous
and level, the rule should be to
keep the level of track well
above the surface of the
ground, in order to insure
good drainage and freedom
from snow-drifts.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p>The question of avoidance of obstruction by snow is a very serious
one upon the Rocky Mountain lines, and they could not be
worked without the device of snow-sheds&mdash;another purely American
invention. There
are said to be six miles
of stanchly built snow-sheds
on the Canadian
Pacific and sixty
miles on the Central
Pacific Railway. The
quantity of snow falling
is enormous, sometimes amounting to 250,000 cubic yards,
weighing over 100,000 tons, in one slide. It is stated by the engineers
of the Canadian Pacific, that the force of the air set in
motion by these avalanches
has mown
down large trees, not
struck by the snow
itself. Their trunks, from one to two feet in diameter, remain,
split as if struck by lightning.</p>

<p>After the railway line has been finally located, the next duty of
the engineers is to prepare the work for letting. Land-plans are
made, from which the right of way is secured. From the sections,
the quantities are taken out. Plans of bridges and culverts are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
made; and a careful specification of all the works on the line is
drawn up.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_021a.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Making an Embankment.</div>
</div>

<p>The works are then let, either to one large contractor or to
several smaller ones, and the labor of construction begins. The
duties of the engineers are to stake out the work for the contractors,
make monthly returns of its progress, and see that it is well
done and according
to the specifications
and contract. The
line is divided into
sections, and an engineer,
with his assistants,
is placed
in charge of each.
Where the works
are heavy, the contractors
build shanties
for their men
and teams near the heavy cuttings or embankments. It is the custom
to take out heavy cuttings by means of the machine called a
steam shovel, which will dig as many yards in a day as 500 men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>On the prairies of the West the road-bed is thrown up from
ditches on each side, either by men with wheelbarrows and carts,
or by means of a ditching-machine, which can move 3,000 yards of
earth daily. In this case
the track follows immediately
after the embankment,
and the men live
in cars fitted up as boarding-shanties,
and moved
forward as fast as required.
If the country contains
suitable stone, the
culverts and bridge abutments
are built by gangs
of masons and stone-cutters,
who move from point
to point. But the general
practice is to put in temporary
trestle-work of
timber resting upon piles,
which trestle-work is renewed
in the shape of
stone culverts covered
by embankments, or iron
bridges resting on stone abutments and built after the road is running.</p>

<p>The pile-driver plays a very important part therefore in the
construction of our railroads, and has been brought to great perfection.
It is worked by a small boiler and engine, and gives its
blows with great rapidity. It drags the piles up to leaders and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
lifts them into place by steam-power, so that it is worked by a
small gang of men. Finally, it is as portable as a pedler's cart,
and as soon as it has finished one job it is taken to pieces, packed
upon wagons, and
moved on to the next
job.</p>

<p>Tunnels are neither
so long nor so frequent
upon American railways
as upon those of
Europe. The longest
are from two to two
and a half miles long,
except one, the Hoosac, about
four miles. Sometimes they
are unavoidable.
The ridge called Bergen
Hill, west of Hoboken,
N. J., is a case
in point. This is
pierced by the tunnels
of the West Shore, of
the Delaware, Lackawanna,
and Western,
and of the Erie, the
last two of which, as
shown on <a href="#Page_25">page 25</a>, are
placed at different levels
to enable one road
to pass over the other.</p>

<p>It is by our system of using sharp curves that we avoid tunnels.
It may be said, in general terms, that American engineers
have shown more skill in avoiding the necessity of tunnels than
could possibly be shown in constructing them. When we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
obliged to use tunnels, or to make deep cuttings in rocks, our
labors are greatly assisted by the use of power-drills worked by
compressed air and by the use of high explosives, such as dynamite,
giant powder, rend-rock,
etc. Rocks can now be removed in less than half the time formerly
required, when ordinary blasting-powder was used in hand-drilled
holes.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>From data furnished by Mr. D. J. Whittemore, chief engineer
of the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul system (which had a total
length of 5,688 miles on January 1, 1888), the length of open
bridges on these lines was 115<sup>91</sup>/<sub>100</sub> miles, and of culverts covered
over with embankment, 39<sup>2</sup>/<sub>10</sub> miles. "Everything," says Mr.
Whittemore, "not covered with earth, except cattle guards, be the
span 10 or 400 feet, is called a bridge. Everything covered with
earth is called a culvert. Wherever we are far removed from
suitable quarries, we build a wooden culvert in preference to a
pile bridge, if we can get six inches of filling over it. These culverts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
are built of roughly
squared logs, and are large
enough to draw an iron
pipe through them of sufficient
diameter to take care
of the water. We do this
because we believe that we
lessen the liability to accident,
and that the culvert
can be maintained after decay has begun, much longer than a piled
bridge with stringers to carry the track. Had we good quarries
along our line, stone would be cheaper. Many thousands of dollars
have been spent by this company in building masonry that after
twenty to twenty-five years shows such signs of disintegration that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
we confine masonry work now only to stone that we can procure
from certain quarries known to be good."</p>

<p>Mr. Whittemore is an engineer of great experience, skill, and
judgment, and there is food for much reflection in these words of
his: First&mdash;that it is better to use temporary wooden structures,
to be afterward renewed in good stone, rather than to build of the
stone of the locality, unless first-class. Second&mdash;that a structure
covered with earth is much safer than an open bridge; which, if
short and apparently insignificant, may be, through neglect, a most
serious point of danger, as was shown in the dreadful accident of
1887 on the Toledo, Peoria, and Western road in Illinois, where
one hundred and fifty persons were killed and wounded, and by
the equally avoidable accident on the Florida and Savannah line,
in March, 1888. Had these little trestles been changed to culverts
covered with earth, many valuable lives would not have been lost.</p>

<p>It was safely estimated that there were, in 1888, 208,749
bridges of all kinds, amounting in length to 3,213 miles, in the
United States.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The wooden bridge and the wooden trestle are purely American
products, although they were invented by Leonardo da Vinci
in the sixteenth century. From the above statistics it will be seen
how much our American railways owe to them, for without them
over 150,000 miles could never have been built.</p>

<p>The art of building wooden truss-bridges was developed by
Burr &amp; Wernwag, two Pennsylvania carpenters, some of whose
works are still in use after eighty years of faithful duty (<a href="#Page_28">p. 28</a>).
A bridge built by Wernwag across the Delaware in 1803 was
used as a highway bridge for forty-five years, was then strengthened
and used as a railway bridge for twenty-seven years more,
and was finally superseded by the present iron bridge in 1875.</p>

<p>These old bridge-builders were very particular about the quality
of their timber, and never put any into a bridge less than two
years old. But when we began to build railways, everything was
done in a hurry, and nobody could wait for seasoned timber. This
led to the invention of the Howe truss, by the engineer of that
name, which had the advantage of being adjustable with screws
and nuts, so that the shrinkage could be taken up, and which
had its parts connected in such a way that they were able to bear
the heavy concentrated weight of locomotives without crushing.
This bridge was used on all railways, new and old, from 1840 to
about 1870. Had it been free from liability to decay and burn up,
we should probably not be building iron and steel bridges now,
except for long spans of over 200 feet; and as the table opposite
shows, the largest number of our spans are less than 100 feet
long.</p>

<p>The Howe truss forms an excellent bridge, and is still used in
the West on new roads, with the intention of substituting iron
trusses after the roads are opened.</p>

<p>After 1870, the weights both of locomotives and other rolling
stock began to be increased very rapidly. This, together with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the development of the manufacture of iron, and especially the invention
of rolled beams and of eye-bars, gave a great impetus to
the construction of iron bridges. At first cast-iron was used for
the compression members, but the development of the rolling-mill
soon enabled us
to make all parts of
rolled iron sections at
no greater cost, and
rolled iron, being a
less uncertain material,
has replaced cast-iron
entirely. Iron
bridges came in direct
competition with the
less costly Howe truss,
and during the first
decade of their construction
every attempt
was made to build them with as few pounds of iron as
would meet the strains.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_028.jpg" width="350" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Old Burr Wooden Bridge.</div>
</div>

<p>S. Whipple, C.E., published a book in 1847 which was the
first attempt ever made to solve the mathematical questions upon
which the due proportioning of iron truss-bridges depends. This
work bore fruit, and a race of bridge designers sprang up. The
first iron bridges were modelled after their wooden predecessors,
with high trusses and short panels. Riveted connections were
avoided, and every part was so designed that it might be quickly
and easily erected upon staging or false works, placed in the river.
This was very necessary, for our rivers are subject to sudden
freshets, and if we had adopted the English system of riveting together
all the connections, the long time required before the bridge
became self-sustaining would have been a serious element of
danger.</p>

<p>Following the practice of wooden bridge building, iron bridges
were contracted for by the foot, and not by the pound as is now
the custom. To this accidental circumstance is greatly due the
development of the American iron bridge. The engineer representing
the railway company fixed the lengths of spans, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
general dimensions, and also the loads to be carried and the maximum
strains to be allowed. The contracting engineer was left
perfectly free to design his bridge, and he strained every nerve
to find the form of truss and the arrangement of its parts that
should give the required strength with the least number of pounds
weight per foot, so that he could beat his competitors. When the
different plans were handed in, an expert examined them and rejected
those whose parts were too small to meet the strains. Of
those found to be correctly proportioned, the lowest bid took the
work.</p>

<p>By the rule of the survival of the fittest all badly designed
forms of trusses disappeared and only two remained: one the
original truss designed by Mr. Whipple, and the other, the well-known
triangular, or "Warren" girder, so called after its English
inventor.</p>

<p>It speaks well for the skill and honesty of American bridge engineers
that many of their old bridges are still in use, designed for
loads of 2,500 pounds per lineal foot, and now daily carrying loads
of 4,000 pounds and over per foot. Sometimes the floor has been
replaced by a stronger one, but the trusses still remain and do good
service. The writer may be permitted to point to the bridge over
the Mississippi River at Quincy, Ill., built in 1869, as an example.
Most bridge-accidents can be traced to derailed trains striking the
trusses and knocking them down. Engineers (both those specially
connected with bridge works, and those in charge of railways)
know much better now what is wanted, and the managers of railways
are willing to pay for the best article. The introduction of
mild steel is a great step in advance. This material has an ultimate
strength, in the finished piece, of 63,000 to 65,000 pounds per
square inch, or forty per cent. more than iron, and it is tough
enough to be tied in a knot, or punched into the shape of a bowl,
while cold. With this material it is as easy to construct spans of
500 feet as it was spans of 250 feet in iron.</p>

<p>Bridges are now designed to carry much heavier loads than
formerly. The best practice adopts riveted connections except at
the junction of the chord-bars and the main diagonals, where pins
and eyes are still very properly used. Plate girders below the
track are preferred up to 60 or 70 feet long, then riveted lattice up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to 125 feet. The wind
strains also are now
provided for with a
considerable excess of
material, amounting in
very long spans to
nearly as much as the
strains due to gravity.
Observing the rule
that no bridge can be
stronger than its weakest
part, a vast deal of
care and skill has been applied
in perfecting the connections
of the parts of a
truss, and many valuable experiments
have been made
which have greatly enlarged
our knowledge of this difficult
subject. The introduction
of riveting by the power
of steam or compressed air
is another very great improvement.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

iron and steel, of which the
Kinzua viaduct, illustrated

branch line from the Erie, connecting that system with valuable
coal-fields, strikes the valley of the Kinzua, a small creek, about
15 miles southwest of Bradford, Pa. At the point suitable for
crossing, this ravine is about half a mile wide and over 300 feet
deep. At first it was proposed to run down and cross the creek
at a low level by some of the devices heretofore illustrated in this
article. But finally the engineering firm of Clarke, Reeves &amp; Co.
agreed to build the viaduct, shown above, for a much less sum than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
any other method of crossing would have cost. This viaduct was
built in four months. It is 305 feet high and about 2,400 feet long.
The skeleton piers were first erected by means of their own posts,
and afterward the girders were placed by means of a travelling
scaffold on the top, projecting over about 80 feet. No staging of
any kind was used, nor even ladders, as the men climbed up the
diagonal rods of the piers, as a cat will run up a tree.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place for the writer to state here what, in
his belief, is the next series of steps to be taken to insure safety in
travelling over our bridges: Replace, wherever possible, all temporary
trestles by wood or stone culverts covered with earth.
Where this cannot be done, build strong iron or steel bridges and
viaducts with as short spans as possible and having no trusses
above the
track where
it can possibly
be helped.
Cover
these and all
new bridges
with a solid
deck of rolled-steel
corrugated
plates, coated
with asphalt
to prevent
rusting.
Place on
this broken
stone ballast, and bed the ties in it as in the ordinary form of
road-bed.</p>

<p>By this means the usual shock felt in passing from the elastic
embankment to the comparatively solid bridge will be done away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Has a crack formed in a wheel or axle, this shock generally develops
it into a break, the car or engine is derailed, and if it strikes
the truss the bridge is wrecked. The cost of this proposed safety
floor is insignificant, compared with the security resulting from it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The improvements in the processes of putting in the foundations
of bridges have been as great as those above water. All have
shortened greatly the time necessary, and have made the results
more certain. The American system may briefly be described as
an abandonment of the old engineering device of coffer-dams, by
which the bed of the river is enclosed by a water-tight fence and
the water pumped out. For this we substitute driving piles and
sawing them off under water; or sinking cribs down to a hard
bottom through the water. In both cases we sink the masonry,
built in a great water-tight box (called a caisson) with a thick
bottom of solid timber, until it finally rests on the heads of the piles
sawn to a level, or on the top of a crib which is filled with stone,
dumped out of a barge. Sometimes it is filled with concrete
lowered through the water by special apparatus.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Another process, developed within the last twenty years, is to
sink cribs through soft or unreliable material to a harder stratum
by compressed air. This is an improvement on the old diving-bell.
The air, forced into the bell-shaped cavity, expels the water and
allows the men to work and remove the material, which is taken
up by a device called an air-lock. The crib slowly sinks, carrying
the masonry on its top.</p>

<p>By this means the foundations of the Brooklyn bridge and of
the St. Louis bridge were sunk a little over 100 feet below water.
A recent invention is that of a German engineer, Herr Poetsch,
who freezes the sand by inserting tubes filled with a freezing mixture,
and then excavates it as if it were solid rock.</p>

<p>The process of sinking open cribs through the water by weighting
them and dredging out the material was followed at the new
bridge recently built over the Hudson at Poughkeepsie, where
the cribs were sunk 130 feet below water, and at the bridge building
over the Hawkesbury River, in Australia. The Hawkesbury piers
are sunk to a depth of 175 feet below water, and are the deepest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
foundations yet put in. The writer (who derives his knowledge
from being one of the designing and executive engineers of both
these bridges) sees no difficulty in putting down foundations by
this process of open dredging to even much greater depths. The
compressed-air process is limited to about 110 feet in depth.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The most notable invention of latter days in bridge construction
is that of the cantilever bridge, which is a system devised to
dispense with staging, or false works, where from the great depth,
or the swift current, of the river, this would be difficult, or, as in the
case of the Niagara River, impossible to make. The word cantilever
is used in architecture to signify the lower end of a rafter,
which projects beyond the wall of a building, and supports the roof
above. It is from an Italian word, taken from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cantilabrum</i>
(used by Vitruvius), meaning the <em>lip of the rafter</em>. If two
beams were pushed out from the shores of a stream until they met
in the centre, and these two beams were long enough to run back
from the shores until their weight, aided by a few stones, held them
down, we should have a primitive form of the cantilever, but one
which in principle would not differ from the actual cantilever
bridges. This is another American invention, although it has been
developed by British engineers&mdash;Messrs. Fowler &amp; Baker&mdash;in their
huge bridge now building across the Forth, in Scotland, of a size
which dwarfs everything hitherto done in this country, the Brooklyn
bridge not excepted.</p>

<p>The first design of which we have any record was that of a
bridge planned by Thomas Pope, a ship carpenter of New York,
who, in 1810, published a book giving his designs for an arched
bridge of timber across the North River at Castle Point, of 2,400
feet span. Mr. Pope called this an arch, but his description clearly
shows it to have been what we now call a cantilever. As was the
fashion of the day, he indulged in a poetical description:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Like half a Rainbow rising on yon shore,</p>
<p class="verse">While its twin partner spans the semi o'er,</p>
<p class="verse">And makes a perfect whole that need not part</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_034.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">View of Thomas Pope's Proposed Cantilever (1810).</div>
</div>

<p>The first railway cantilever bridge in the world was built by
the late C. Shaler Smith, C.E., one of our most accomplished
bridge engineers. This was a bridge over the deep gorge of the
Kentucky River.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The next was a bridge on the Canadian
Pacific, in British Columbia, designed by C. C. Schneider, C.E.
A very similar bridge is that over the Niagara River, designed
by the same engineer in conjunction with Messrs. Field &amp; Hayes,
Civil Engineers. This bridge was the first to receive the distinctive
name of cantilever.</p>

<p>The new bridge at Poughkeepsie has three of these cantilevers,
connected by two fixed spans, as shown in the illustration (pg. 36).
The fixed spans have horizontal lower chords, and really extend
beyond each pier and up the inclined portions, to where the bottom
chord of the cantilever is horizontal. At these points the
junctions between the spans are made, and arranged in such a way,
by means of movable links, that expansion and contraction due to
changes of temperature can take place. The fixed spans are 525
feet long. Their upper chord, where the tracks are placed, is 212
feet above water. These spans required stagings to build them
upon. These stagings were 220 feet above water, and rested on
piles, driven through 60 feet of water and 60 feet of mud, making
the whole height of the temporary staging 332 feet, or within 30
feet of the height of Trinity Church steeple, in New York. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
time occupied in building one of these stagings and then erecting
the steel-work upon it was about four months.</p>

<p>The cantilever spans were erected, as shown in the illustration
on <a href="#Page_37">page 37</a>, without any stagings at all below, and entirely from
the two overhead travelling scaffolds, shown in the engraving.
These scaffolds were moved out daily from the place of beginning
over the piers, until they met in the centre. The workmen
hoisted up the different pieces of steel from a barge in the river
below and put them into place, using suspended planks to walk
upon. The time saved by this method was so great that one of
these spans of 548 feet long was erected in less than four weeks,
or one-seventh of the time which would have been required if
stagings had been used.</p>

<div class="caption">Pope's Cantilever in Process of Erection. (From his "Treatise on Bridge Architecture.")</div>
</div>

<p>At the Forth Bridge, all the projecting cantilevers will be built
from overhead scaffolds, 360 feet above the water. It contains
two spans of 1,710 feet each. When spans of this length are used,
the rivets become very long&mdash;seven inches&mdash;and it would be impossible
to make a good job by hand riveting. Hence a power-riveter
is used in riveting the work upon the staging. A steam-engine
raises up a heavy mass of cast-iron, called "the accumulator;"
the
weight of
this in descending
is
transmitted
through
tubes of water,
and its
power increased
by
contracting the area of pressure, until some twenty tons can be
applied to the head of each rivet. One rivet per minute can be
put in with this tool.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It will be seen that most of the great saving of time in modern
construction of bridges and other parts of railways is due to improved
machinery. The engineer of to-day is probably not more
skilful than his ancestor, who, in periwig and cue, breeches and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
silk stockings, is represented in old prints supervising a gang of
laborers, who slowly lift the ram of a pile-driver by hauling on one
end of a rope passed over a pulley-wheel. The modern engineer
has that useful servant, steam, and the history of modern engineering
is chiefly the history of those inventions by which steam has
been able to supersede manual labor&mdash;such as pile-drivers, steam-shovels,
steam-dredges, and other similar tools.</p>

<p>After the road-bed of a railway is completed and covered with
a good coat of gravel or stone-ballast, and after all the temporary
structures have been replaced by permanent ones, that part of the
work may be said to be done, requiring only that the damages of
storms should be repaired. But the track of a railway is never
done. It is always wearing out and always being replaced.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_037.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Erection of a Cantilever.</div>
</div>

<p>Some of the early English engineers, not appreciating this, endeavored
to lay down solid stone walls coped with stone cut to a
smooth surface, on which they laid their rails. They called this
"permanent way," as distinguished from the temporary track of
rails and cross-ties used by contractors in building the lines. But
experience soon showed that the temporary track, if supported by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
a bed of broken stone, always kept itself drained and was always
elastic, and remained in much better order than the more expensive
so-called "permanent way." When the increase in the weight of
our rolling stock began to take place, dating from about 1870, iron
rails were found to be wearing out very fast. Some railway men
declared that the railway system had reached its full development.
But in this world the supply generally equals the demand. When
a thing is very much wanted, it is sure to come, sooner or later.
The process of making steel invented by, and named after, Henry
Bessemer, of England, and perfected by A. L. Holley, of this
country, gave us a steel rail which at the present time costs less
than one of iron, and has a life five or six times as long, even
under the heavy loads of to-day. We are now approaching very
near the limit of what the rail will carry, while the joints are becoming
less able to do their duty. Bad joints mean rough track.
Rough track means considerably greater expenditure both for its
maintenance and that of all the rolling stock, as the blows and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
shocks do reciprocal damage, both to the rails and to that which
runs on them. Hence all railway managers are now devoting
more care and attention to their tracks.</p>

<p>In laying track on a new railway, if it be in an old-settled country
where other railroads are near and the highways good, the ties
are delivered in piles along the line where wanted, and the haul of
the rails is comparatively short.
The ties are laid down, spaced
and bedded, adzed off to a true
bearing, and the rails laid
upon them; the workmen being
divided into gangs, each
doing a different part of the
work. After the track is laid, the ballast-trains come along and
cover the roadbed with gravel. The track is raised, the gravel
tamped well under the ties, and the track is ready for use.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_039.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Rail Making.</div>
</div>

<p>The road is then divided into sections about five miles long.
On each section there is a section-boss, with four to six laborers.
Their duty is to pass over the track at least twice a day in their
hand-car, to examine every joint, and where one is found low or
out of line, to bring it back to its true position by tamping gravel
under it and moving the track. They have also to see that all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
ditches are kept clear of water, a most essential point, as without
good drainage the ground under gravel ballast becomes soft, and
the mud is churned up into the gravel, and the whole soon gets
into bad order.</p>

<p>They have to see that the fences are all right, that trees and
telegraph poles do not fall across the track, that wooden bridges
do not burn down, that iron and stone bridges are not undermined
by freshets, and always to set up danger signals to warn the trains.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_041.jpg" width="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Track Laying.</div>
</div>

<p>It is admitted by competent judges, that the track of the Pennsylvania
Railroad is the best in this country, and one of the best
in the world. It is kept up to its high standard of excellence by a
system of competitive examinations.</p>

<p>About the first of November, in each year, after the season's
work has been done, a tour of inspection is made over all the lines,
on a train of cars expressly prepared, consisting of two or more
cars not unlike ordinary box cars with the front end taken out.
Each car is pushed in front of an engine, and goes slowly over the
line, by daylight only, so that the inspecting party may have a full
view of the road.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania road is divided into Grand Divisions, Superintendents'
Divisions, of about 100 miles long, Supervisors' Divisions,
of about 30 miles, and Subdivisions, of 2½ miles.</p>

<p>The examining committee for each Supervisor's Division consists
of the supervisors of other divisions. As they pass along,
they mark on a card. One sub-committee marks the condition of
the alignment and surfacing of the rails; another the condition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the joints and the spacing of the ties; another the ballast, switches,
and sidings; another the ditches, road-crossings, station grounds.
The marks range <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'from 1 to 10'">from 0 to 10</ins>, 0 being very bad, 5 medium, and
10 perfection. When the trip is done these reports are all collected
and the average is taken for each division.</p>

<p>As an inducement to the supervisors and the foremen of the
Subdivisions to excel on their division, premiums are given as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquoty">

<p>$100 to the supervisor having the best yard on his Grand Division.</p>

<p>$100 each to the supervisors having the best Supervisor's Division on each Superintendent's
Division of 100 miles.</p>

<p>$75 to the foreman having the best subdivision of 2½ miles on each Grand Division.</p>

<p>$60 to each foreman having the best subdivision on his Superintendent's Division,
including yards.</p>

<p>$50 to the foreman having the best subdivision on each Supervisor's Division.</p></div>

<p>In addition to the above there are two premiums of honor given
by the general manager, which bring into competition with each
other those parts of the main line lying on either side of Philadelphia,
viz.:</p>

<div class="blockquoty">

<p>$100 to the supervisor having the best line and surface between Pittsburg and Jersey
City.</p>

<p>$50 to the second best ditto.</p></div>

<p>If a supervisor or foreman of subdivision receives one of the
higher premiums, he is not allowed to be a competitor for any
others premiums, except the premiums of honor.</p>

<p>The advantages of these inspections and premiums are these:
Every man knows exactly what the standard of excellence is, and
strives to have his section reach it. Under the old system, a man
never got off of his own section, and had no means of comparison,
and like all untravelled persons, became conceited.</p>

<p>The standard of excellence becomes higher and higher every
year. Perfect fairness prevails, as the men themselves are the
judges. The officers of the road make no marks, but usually
look on and see that there is fair play.</p>

<p>This brings the officers and men nearer together, and shows
the men how all are working for the common good. An agreeable
break is made in the monotony of the men's lives. They have
something to look forward to better than a spree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>It is by the adoption of such methods as these that strikes will
be prevented in the future. It encourages an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>
among the men, and educates them in every way.</p>

<p>This system was first devised and put in operation on the
Pennsylvania Railroad in 1879, by Mr. Frank Thomson, General
Manager, to whom the credit of it is justly due.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>I have thus endeavored to trace the history of the building of
a railway; and it must have been seen, from what has been said,
that the evolution of the railway and of its rolling stock follows the
same laws which govern the rest of the world: adaptation to circumstances
decides what is fittest, and that alone survives. The
scrap-heap of a great railway tells its own story.</p>

<p>Our railways have now reached a development which is wonderful.
The railways of the United States, if placed continuously,
would reach more than half-way to the moon. Their bridges
alone would reach from New York to Liverpool. Notwithstanding
the number of accidents that we read of in the daily papers,
statistics show that less persons are killed annually on railways
than are killed annually by falling out of windows.</p>

<p>Railways have so cheapened the cost of transportation that,
while a load of wheat loses all of its value by being hauled one
hundred miles on a common road, meat and flour enough to supply
one man a year can, according to Mr. Edward Atkinson, be
hauled 1,500 miles from the West to the East for one day's wages
of that man, if he be a skilled mechanic. If freight charges are
diminished in the future as in the past, this can soon be done for
one day's wages of a common laborer.</p>

<p>The number of persons employed in constructing, equipping,
and operating our railways is about two millions.</p>

<p>The combined armies and navies of the world, while on peace
footing, will draw from gainful occupations 3,455,000 men.</p>

<p>Those create wealth&mdash;these destroy it. Is it any wonder that
America is the richest country in the world?</p>

<p>The rapidity with which it is possible to build railways over
the prairies of the West is extraordinary. It is true that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
amount of earth necessary to
be moved is much less than
on the railways of the East.
In Iowa and Wisconsin, the
amount runs from 20,000 to
25,000 yards per mile, while
in Dakota it is only 12,000 to
15,000 yards per mile. After making all due allowance for this,
the result is still remarkable.</p>

<p>The Manitoba system was extended in 1887 through Dakota

men, with about 3,500 teams, commanded by General D. C. Shepard,
of St. Paul, a veteran engineer and contractor, did it all between
April 2 and October 19. All materials and subsistence

cast up from the side ditches, sometimes by carts, and sometimes
by the digging machine.</p>

    </div>

<p>Everything was done with military organization, except that
what was left behind was a railway and not earth-work lines of defence.
Assuming that this railway, ready for its equipment, cost
$15,100 per mile, or $8,175,000, and if it be true, as statisticians
tell us, that every dollar expended in building railways in a new
country adds ten to the value of land and other property, then this
six months' campaign shows a solid increase of the wealth of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
country of over eighty millions of dollars. Had it been necessary
for our Government to keep an army of observation of the same
size on the Canadian frontier, there would have been a dead loss
of over eight millions of dollars, and the only result would have
been a slight reduction of the Treasury surplus.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that this railway was built after the
American system: when the rails were laid, so as to carry trains,
it was not much more than half finished; the track had to be ballasted,
the temporary wooden structures replaced by stone and
iron, and many buildings and miles of sidings were yet to be constructed.
But it began to earn money from the very day the last
rail was laid, and out of its earnings, and the credit thereby acquired,
it will complete itself.</p>

<p>And this is only one instance out of many. The armies of
peace are working all over our country, increasing our wealth, and
binding all parts into a common whole. We have here the true
answer to the Carlyles and the Ruskins who ask: "What is the
use of all this? Is a man any better who goes sixty miles an hour
than one who went five miles an hour?" "Were we not happier
when our fields were covered with their golden harvests, than
now, when our wheat is brought to us from Dakota?"</p>

<p>The grand function of the railway is to change the whole basis
of civilization from military to industrial. The talent, the energy,
the money, which is expended in maintaining the whole of Europe
as an armed camp is here expended in building and maintaining
railways, with their army of two millions of men. Without the
help of railways the rebellion of the Southern States could never
have been put down, and two great standing armies would have
been necessary. By the railways, aided by telegraphs, it is easy
to extend our Federal system over an entire continent, and thus
dispense forever with standing armies.</p>

<p>The moral effect of this upon Europe is great, but its physical
effect is still greater. American railways have nearly abolished
landlordism in Ireland, and they will one day abolish it in England,
and over the continent of Europe. So long as Europe was
dependent for food upon its own fields, the owner of those fields
could fix his own rental. This he can no longer do, owing to the
cheapness of transportation from Australia and from the prairies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
America, due to the inventions of Watt, the Stephensons, Bessemer,
and Holley.</p>

<p>With the wealth of the landlord his political power will pass
away. The government of European countries will pass out of
the hands of the great landowners, but not into those of the
rabble, as is feared. It will pass into the same hands that govern
America to-day&mdash;the territorial democracy, the owners of small
farms, and the manufacturers and merchants. When this comes to
pass, attempts will be made to settle international disputes by arbitration
instead of war, following the example of the Geneva arbitration
between the two greatest industrial nations of the world.
Whether our Federal system will ever extend to the rest of the
world, no one knows, but we do know that without railways it
would be impossible.</p>

<p>When we consider the effects of all these wonderful changes
upon the sum of human happiness, we must admit that the engineer
should justly take rank with statesmen and soldiers, and that no
greater benefactors to the human race can be named than the
Stephensons and their American disciples&mdash;Allen, Rogers, Jervis,
Winans, Latrobe, and Holley.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> It is proper here to say that English engineers now appreciate the merits of the American swivelling
truck or bogie. In the article on Railways in the last edition of the "Encyclopædia Britannica,"
speaking of locomotives, the author of the article, who is an English engineer of high authority, says:
"American practice, many years since, arrived at two leading types of locomotive for passenger, and
for goods traffic. The passenger locomotive has eight wheels, of which four in front are framed in a
bogie, and the four wheels behind are coupled drivers. <em>This is the type to which English practice has

safe so long as the trains remain upon the rails and do not strike the side trusses. The wooden trestles
are a constant source of danger from decay or burning or from derailed trains, and should be replaced
by permanent structures as fast as time and money will allow.</p></div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_047dc.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="p1x drop-cap">There are one hundred and fifty
thousand miles of railway in the
United States: three hundred thousand
miles of rails&mdash;in length enough
to make twelve steel girdles for the
earth's circumference. This enormous
length of rail is wonderful&mdash;we do not
really grasp its significance. But the
rail itself, the little section of steel, is
an engineering feat. The change of its form
from the curious and clumsy iron pear-head of thirty years ago to
the present refined section of steel is a scientific development. It
is now a beam whose every dimension and curve and angle are
exactly suited to the tremendous work it has to do. The loads it
carries are enormous, the blows it receives are heavy and constant,
but it carries the loads and bears the blows and does its duty.
The locomotive and the modern passenger and freight cars are
great achievements; and so is the little rail which carries them all.</p>

<p>The railway to-day is one of the matter-of-fact associations of
our active life. We use it so constantly that it requires some little
effort to think of it as a wonderful thing; a creation of man's inge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>nuity,
which did not exist when our grandfathers were young. Its
long bridges, high viaducts, and dark tunnels may be remarked and
remembered by the traveller, but the narrow way of steel, the road
itself, seems but a simple work. And yet the problem of location,
the determination, foot by foot and mile by mile, of where the line
must go, calls in its successful solution for the highest skill of the
engineer, whose profession before the railway was created hardly
existed at all. Locomotives now climb heights which a few years
ago no vehicle on wheels could ascend. The writer, with some
engineer friends, was in the mountains of Colorado during the
summer of 1887, and saw a train of very intelligent donkeys loaded
with ore from the mines, to which no access could be had but by
those sure-footed beasts. Within a year one of that party of engineers
had located and was building a railway to those very
mines. No heights seem too great to-day, no valleys too deep, no
cañons too forbidding, no streams too wide; if commerce demands,
the engineer will respond and the railways will be built.</p>

<p>The location of the line of a railway through difficult country
requires the trained judgment of an engineer of special experience,
and the most difficult country is not by any means that which might
at first be supposed. A line through a narrow pass almost locates
itself. But the approach to a summit through rolling country is
often a serious problem. The rate of grade must be kept as light
as possible, and must never exceed the prescribed maximum. The
cuttings and the embankments must be as shallow as they can be
made&mdash;the quantities of material taken from the excavations should
be just about enough to make adjacent embankments. The curves
must be few and of light radius&mdash;never exceeding an arranged
limit. The line must always be kept as direct as these considerations
will allow&mdash;so that the final location will give the shortest
practicable economical distance from point to point. Many a mile
of railway over which we travel now at the highest speed has been
a weary problem to the engineer of location, and he has often accomplished
a really greater success by securing a line which seems
to closely fit the country over which it runs without marking itself
sharply upon nature's moulding, than if he had with apparent boldness
cut deep into the hills and raised embankments and viaducts
high over lowlands and valleys.</p>

<div class="center caption">View Down the Blue from Rocky Point, Denver,<br />

<p>But roads must run through
many regions where very different
measures must be taken to
secure a location practicable for
traffic. For instance, a line at
a high elevation approaches a
wide valley which it must cross.
The rate of descent is fixed by
the established maximum grade,
and the sides of the valley are
much steeper than that rate.
Then the engineer must gain
distance&mdash;that is to say, he
must make the line long enough
to overcome the vertical height. This can often be accomplished
by carrying it up the valley on one side and down on the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Tributary valleys can be made use of if necessary, and the desired
crossing thus accomplished. But at times even these expedients
will not suffice. Then the line is made to bend upon itself and
wind down the hillside upon benches cut into the earth, or rock,
curving at points where nature affords any sort of opportunity, and
reaching the valley at last in long convolutions like the path of a
great serpent on the mountain side. These lines often show several
tiers of railway, one directly above the other, as may be seen
in the illustrations on pages 49 and 51.</p>

    </div>

<p>The long trestle shown in the illustration opposite is an example
of an expedient often of the greatest service in railway construction.
These trestles are built of wood, simply but strongly framed together,
and are entirely effective for the transport of traffic for a
number of years. Then they must be renewed, or, what is better,
be replaced by embankment, which can be gradually made by
depositing the material from cars on the trestle itself. The trestle
illustrated is interesting as conforming to the curve of the line,
which in that country, the mountains of Colorado, was probably a
necessity of location.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Where the direct turning of a line upon itself may not be necessary,
there may and often must be bold work done in the construction
of the road upon a mountain side. It must be supported
where necessary by walls built up from suitable foundations, often
only secured at a great depth below the grade of the road. Projecting
points of rock must be cut through, and any practicable
natural shelf or favorable formation must be made use of, as in the
picture on <a href="#Page_61">page 61</a>. In some of the mountain locations, galleries
have been cut directly into the rock, the cliff overhanging the roadway,
and the line being carried in a horizontal cut or niche in the
solid wall.</p>

<p>The Oroya and the Chimbote railways in South America
demanded constant locations of this character. At many points
it was necessary to suspend the persons making the preliminary
measurements from the cliff above. The engineer who made these
locations told the writer that on the Oroya line the galleries were
often from 100 to 400 feet above the base of the cliff, and were generally
reached from above. Rope ladders were used to great advantage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
One 64 feet long and one 106 feet long covered the usual
practice, and were sometimes spliced together. The side ropes
were ¾ and 1¼ inches in diameter, and the rounds of wood 1¼ inches
in diameter, and 16 inches and 24 inches long. These were notched
at the ends and passed through the ropes, to which they were afterward
lashed. These ladders could be rolled up and carried about
on donkeys or mules. When swung over the side of a cliff and
secured at the top, and when practicable at the bottom, they formed
a very useful instrument in location and construction. For simple
examination of the cliff, and for rough or broken slopes not exceeding
70 to 80 degrees, an active fellow would, after some experience,
walk up and down such a slope simply grasping the rope in his
hands. If required to do any work he would secure the rope
about his body, or wind it around his arm, leaving his hands comparatively
free for light work.</p>

<p>The boatswain's chair&mdash;consisting of a wooden seat 6 inches
wide and two feet long, through the ends of which pass the side
ropes, looped at the top, and having their ends knotted&mdash;is a particularly
convenient seat to use where cliffs overhang to a slight
degree. The riggers were generally Portuguese sailors, who
seemed to have more agility and less fear than any other men to
be found. At Cuesta Blanca, on the Oroya, a prominent discoloration
on the cliff served as a triangulation point for locating the chief
gallery. Men were swung over the side of the cliff in a cage about
2½ feet by 6 feet, open at the top and on the side next the rock.
This was a peculiar cliff about 1,000 feet high, rising from the river
at a general slope of about 70 degrees. The grade line of the road
was 420 feet above the river. The Chileno miners climbed up a
rope ladder to a large seam near the grade, where they lived; provisions,
water, etc., being hoisted up to them. The first men sent
over the cliff to begin the preliminary work were lowered in a cage
and took their dinners with them, for fear they would not return to
the work, and that unless a genuine start was made others could
not be induced to take their places. It is safe to say that 80 per
cent. of the sixty odd tunnels on the Oroya and the seven tunnels
on the Chimbote lines were located and constructed on lines
determined by triangulation, and the results were so satisfactory
that the method may be depended upon as the best system for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>

<p>When such a cañon or a narrow valley directly crosses the line
of the road, it must be spanned by a bridge or viaduct. The Kentucky
River Bridge, shown below, is an instance. The Verrugas
Bridge, on the Lima and Oroya Railroad in Peru, is another. This
bridge is at an elevation of 5,836 feet above sea-level. It crosses a
ravine at the bottom of which is a small stream. The bridge is
575 feet long, in four spans, and is supported by iron towers, the
central one of which is 252 feet in height. The construction was
accomplished entirely from above, the material all having been
delivered at the top of the ravine, and the erection was made by
lowering each piece to its position. This was done by the use of
two wire-rope cables, suspended across the ravine from temporary
towers at each end of the bridge.</p>

<p>On the line of the same Oroya Railroad is a striking example
of the difficulties encountered in such mountain country and of the
method by which they have been overcome. A tunnel reaches a
narrow gorge, a truss is thrown across, and the tunnel continued.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Nature's wildest scenery, the deep ravine, the mountain cliffs,
and the graceful truss carrying the locomotive and train safely over
what would seem an impossible pass, here combine to give a vivid
illustration of an engineering feat.</p>

<p>The location of a part of the Mexican Central Railway through
the cut of Nochistongo is peculiarly interesting. Far underneath
the level of this line of railway there was skilfully constructed, in
1608, a tunnel which at that period was a very bold piece of engin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>eering.
It was designed to drain the Valley of Mexico, which has
no natural outlet. This tunnel was more than six miles long and
ten feet wide. It was driven through the formation called <em>tepetate</em>,
a peculiar earth with strata of sand and marl. It was finished in
eleven months. At first excavated without a lining, it was afterward
faced with masonry. It was not entirely protected when a
great flood came, the dikes above gave way, and the tunnel became
obstructed. The City of Mexico was flooded, and it was decided
that, instead of repairing the tunnel an open cut should be made.
The engineer who had constructed the tunnel, Enrico Martinez,
was put in charge of this enormous undertaking, and others took
his place after his death. The cut is believed to be the largest ever
made in the world. For more than a century the work was continued.
Its greatest depth is now 200 feet. It was cut deeper, but
has partially filled with the washings from the slopes. The cost
was enormous, more than 6,000,000 dollars in silver having been
actually disbursed! Wages for workmen were then from 9 to 12
cents a day. All convicts sentenced to hard labor were put at work
in the great cut. The loss of life was very great. Writers of the
time state that more than 100,000 Indians perished while engaged
in the work.</p>

<p>When a line of railway
encountered a
grade too steep for ascent
by the traction
of the locomotive, the
earlier engineers adopted the
inclined plane. Such planes were
in use at important points during
many years. Notable instances
were those by which traffic was
carried across the Alleghany
Mountains, connecting on
each side with the Pennsylvania
railway lines. These
old planes are still visible
from the present Pennsylvania
Railroad where it
crosses the summit west of Altoona. The planes were operated
by stationary engines acting upon cables attached to the cars.
These cables passed around drums at the head of the planes, the
weight of the cars on one track partially
balancing those on the other. Similar
planes were in use also at Albany,
Schenectady, and
other places.</p>

<div class="caption">Trestle on Portland and Ogdensburg Railway,<br />Crawford Notch, White Mountains.</div>
</div>

<p>Another effective
expedient is the central
rack rail. No
better or more successful
example of
this method of construction
can be given
than the Mount
Washington Railway,
illustrated above.
The road was completed
in 1869. Its
length is 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> miles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
its total rise 3,625 feet. Its steepest grade is about 1 foot rise in
every 3 feet in length; the average grade is 1 in 4. It is built of
heavy timber, well bolted to the rock. Low places are spanned by
substantial trestle work. The gauge of the road is 4 feet 7½ inches,
and it is provided with the two ordinary rails and also the central
rack rail, which is really like an iron ladder, the sides being of
angle iron and the cross-pieces of round iron 1½ inches in diameter
and 4 inches apart. Into these plays the central cog-wheel on the
locomotive, which thus climbs this iron ladder with entire safety.
Very complete arrangements are made to control the descent of the
train in case of accident to the machinery. The locomotive is always
below the train, and pushes it up the mountain. Many thousands
of passengers have been transported every year without accident.</p>

<img src="images/i_059.jpg" width="250" height="313" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A Series of Tunnels.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The rack railroad ascending the Righi, in Switzerland, was
copied after the Mount Washington
line. Some improvements in
the construction of the rack rail
and attachments have been introduced
upon mountain roads in
Germany, and this system seems
very advantageous for use in exceptionally
steep locations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When a line of railway meets
in its course a barrier of rock, it is
often best to cut directly through.
If the grade is not too far below
the surface of the rock, the cut is
made like a great trench with the
sides as steep as the nature of
the material will allow. Very deep
cuts are, however, not desirable. The rains bring down upon
their slopes the softer material from above, and the frost detaches
pieces of rock which, falling, may result in serious accidents to
trains. Snow lodges in these deep cuts, at times entirely stopping
traffic, as in the blizzard near New York, in March, 1888.
A tunnel, therefore, while perhaps greater in first cost than a moderately
deep cut, is really often the more economical expedient.</p>

<p>And here is as good a place, perhaps, as any other in this
chapter, to say that true engineering is the economical adaptation
of the means and opportunities existing, to the end desired. Civil
engineering was defined, by one of the greatest of England's engineers,
as "the art of directing the great sources of power in nature
for the use and convenience of man," and that definition was
adopted as a fundamental idea in the charter of the English Institution
of Civil Engineers. But the development of engineering works

    <p>And here is as good a place, perhaps, as any other in this
    chapter, to say that true engineering is the economical adaptation
    of the means and opportunities existing, to the end desired. Civil
    engineering was defined, by one of the greatest of England's engineers,
    as "the art of directing the great sources of power in nature
    for the use and convenience of man," and that definition was
    adopted as a fundamental idea in the charter of the English Institution
    of Civil Engineers. But the development of engineering-works
    in America has been effected successfully by American engineers
    only because they have appreciated another side of the

<p>The remarkable success achieved by engineers in securing
suitable foundations at great depths is, of course, hardly known to
the thousands who constantly see the structures supported on
those foundations, but in any fair consideration of such engineering
achievements this must not be omitted. The beautiful bridge
built by Captain Eads over the Mississippi River at St. Louis,
bold in its design and excellent in its execution, is an object of admiration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to all who visit it, but the impression of its importance
would be greatly magnified if the part below the surface of the
water, which bears the massive towers, and which extends to a
depth twice as great as the height of the pier above the water,
could be visible.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_067.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Railway Pass at Rocky Point in the Rocky Mountains.</div>
</div>

<p>The simplest and most effective foundation is, of course, on
solid rock. In many localities reliable foundations are built upon
earth, when it exists at a suitable depth and of such a character as
properly to sustain the weight. Foundations under water, when
rock or good material occurs at moderate depth, are constructed
frequently by means of the coffer-dam, which is simply an enclosure
made water-tight and properly connected with the bottom of
the stream. The water is then pumped out and the foundation
and masonry built within this temporary dam. When the material
is not of a character to sustain the weight, the next expedient
is the use of piles, which are driven into the ground, often to a
very considerable depth, and sustain the load placed upon them by
the friction upon the sides of the piles of the material in which they
are driven. It is seldom that dependence is placed upon the load
being transferred from the top to the point of the pile, even though
the point may have penetrated to a comparatively solid material.
Wood is generally used for piles, and where the ground is permanently
saturated there seems to be hardly any known limit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
its durability. The substructure of foundations, where it is certain
that they will always be in contact with water, can be, and
generally is, of wood, and the permanency of such foundations
is well established. An exception to this, however, occurs in
salt-water, particularly in warmer countries, where the ravages of
the minute <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Teredo Navalis</i>, and of the still more minute <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Limnoria
Terebrans</i>, destroy the wood in a very short period of time.
These insects, however, do not work below the ground-line or bed
of the water. In many special cases hollow
iron piles are used successfully.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_068.jpg" width="175" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Bridge Pier Founded on Piles.</div>
</div>

<p>The ordinary method of forcing a pile into
the ground is by repeated blows of a hammer
of moderate weight; better success being obtained
by frequent blows of the hammer, lifted
to a slight elevation, than results from a greater
fall, there being danger also in the latter case
of injuring the material of the pile. The use
of the water-jet for sinking piles, particularly in
sand, is interesting. A tube, generally
of ordinary gas-pipe, open at the lower
end, is fastened to the pile; the upper
end is connected by a hose to a powerful
pump and, the pile being placed in
position on the surface of the sand,
water is forced through the tube and
excavates a passage for the pile, which,
by the application of very light pressure,
descends rapidly to the desired depth.
The stream of water must be continuous,
as it rises along the side of the pile
and keeps the sand in a mobile state.
Immediately upon the cessation of pumping,
the sand settles about the pile, and
it is sometimes quite impossible to afterward
move it. The water-jet is used in
sinking iron piles by conducting the
water through the interior of the hollow pile and out of a hole at
its point. The piles of the great iron pier at Coney Island were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
sunk with great celerity in this way. The illustration opposite
shows one of the piers of a bridge founded upon wooden piling.</p>

<p>In many cases it would be impossible to drive piling in such a
way as to insure the durability of the structure above it. This is
particularly true of the foundations of structures crossing many of
our rivers, where the bottom is of material which, in time of flood,
sometimes scours to very remarkable depths; the material often
being replaced when the flood has subsided. The expedient
adopted is the pneumatic tube, or the caisson. Both are merely
applications of the well-known principle of the diving-bell. In the
former case hollow iron tubes, open at the bottom, are sunk to
considerable depths, the water being expelled by air pumped into
the tubes at a pressure sufficient to resist the weight of the water.
Entrance to the tubes is obtained by an air-lock at the top, the
material is excavated from the inside, and sufficient weight placed
upon the tube to force it gradually to the desired depth. When
that depth is attained, the tubes are filled with concrete, and thus
solid pillars of hydraulic concrete, surrounded by cast-iron tubing,
are obtained.</p>

<p>The pneumatic caisson is an enlargement of this idea of the diving-bell.
The caisson is simply a great chamber or box, open at
the bottom; the outside bottom edges are shod and cased with
iron so as to give a cutting surface; the roof and sides are made
of timber, thoroughly bolted together, and of such strength as to
resist the pressure of the structure to be finally founded upon it.
The chamber in the open bottom is of sufficient height to enable
the laborers to work comfortably in it. This caisson is generally
constructed upon the shore in the vicinity of the structure and
towed to the point where the foundation is to be sunk. Air is supplied
by powerful pumps and is forced into the working chamber.
The pressure of the air of course increases constantly as
the caisson descends; it must always be sufficient to overbalance
the weight of the water and thus prevent the water from entering
the chamber.</p>

<p>Descent to the caisson is made through a tube, generally of
wrought iron, and having, at a suitable point, an air-lock, which is
substantially an enlargement of the tube, forming a chamber, and
of sufficient size to accommodate a number of men. This air-lock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
is provided with doors or valves at the top and at the bottom, both
opening downward, and also with small tubes connecting the air-lock
with the chamber below and with the external air above.
Entrance to the caisson is effected through this air-lock. The
lower door, or valve, being at the bottom, closes and is kept closed
by the pressure of the air in the caisson below. After the air-lock
is entered the upper door or valve is shut, and held shut a few
moments, and the tube connecting with the outer air is closed; a
small valve in the tube connecting with the caisson is then opened
gradually and the pressure in the air-lock becomes the same as
that in the chamber below; as soon as this is effected the valve,
or door, at the bottom of the air-lock falls open and the air-lock
becomes really a part of the caisson.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_070.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Pneumatic Caisson.</div>
</div>

<p>A sufficient force of men is employed in the chamber to gradually
excavate the material from its whole surface and from under
the cutting edge, and the masonry structure is founded upon the
top of the caisson and built gradually, so as to give constantly a
sufficient weight to carry the whole construction down to its final
location upon the stable foundation, which may be the bed-rock or
may be some strata of permanent character.</p>

<p>The problem of lighting the chamber was until recently of considerable
difficulty. The rapid combustion under great pressure
made the use of lamps and candles very troublesome, particularly
on account of the dense smoke and large production of lampblack.</p>

<p>The introduction of the electric light has greatly aided in the
more comfortable prosecution of pneumatic foundation work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_071.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Transverse Section of Pneumatic Caisson.</div>
</div>

<p>The removal of rock, or any large mass, from the caisson is effected
through the air-chamber; but the removal of finer material,
as sand or earth, is accomplished by the sand pump or by the
pressure of the air. A tube, extending from the top of the masonry
and kept above the surface by additions, as may be required,
enters the working chamber and is controlled by proper valves.
Lines of tubing and hose extend to all portions of the chamber.
A slight excavation is made and kept filled with water. The bottom
of the tube, or the hose connected with it, is placed in this
excavation, and, the material being agitated so as to be in suspension
in the water, the valve is opened, and the pressure of the air
throws the water and the material held in suspension to the surface,
through the tube, from the end of which it is projected with
great velocity and may be deposited at any desired adjacent point.
This method, however, exhausts the air from the caisson too rapidly
for continuous service. The Eads sand-pump is therefore
generally used. This is an ingenious apparatus, somewhat the
same in principle as the injector which forces water into steam-boilers.
A stream of water is thrown by a powerful pump through
a tube which, at a point near the inlet for the excavated material,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
is enlarged so as to surround another tube. The water is forced
upward with great velocity into the second tube, through a conical
annular opening, and, expelling the atmosphere, carries with it to
the surface a continuous stream of sand and water from the bottom
of the excavation.</p>

<p>This system has been used successfully in the foundations of
piers and abutments of bridges in all parts of the world. The
rapidity of the descent of the caisson varies with the material
through which it has to pass. The speed with which such foundations
are executed is remarkable, when one remembers with what
delicacy and intelligent supervision they have to be balanced and
controlled. In some instances it has been necessary to carry them
to great depths, one at St. Louis being 107 feet below ordinary
water level in the river.</p>

<p>The pressure of air in caissons at these depths is very great;
at 110 feet below the surface of the water it would be 50 pounds
to the square inch. Its effect upon the men entering and working
in the caisson has been carefully noted in various works, and these
effects are sometimes very serious; the frequency of respiration is
increased, the action of the heart becomes excited, and many persons
become affected by what is known as the "caisson disease,"
which is accompanied by extreme pain and in some cases results
in more or less complete paralysis. The careful observations of
eminent physicians who have given this disease special attention
have resulted in the formulation of rules which have reduced the
danger to a minimum.</p>

<div class="caption">At Work in a Pneumatic Caisson&mdash;fifty feet below the surface of the water.</div>
</div>

<p>The execution of work within a deep pneumatic caisson is worth
a moment's consideration. Just above the surface of the water
is a busy force engaged in laying the solid blocks of masonry
which are to support the structure. Great derricks lift the stones
and lay them in their proper position. Powerful pumps are forcing
air, regularly and at uniform pressure, through tubes to the chamber
below. Occasionally a stream of sand and water issues with
such velocity from the discharge pipe that, in the night, the friction
of the particles causes it to look like a stream of living fire. Far
below is another busy force. Under the great pressure and abnormal
supply of oxygen they work with an energy which makes
it impossible to remain there more than a few hours. The water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
from without is only kept from entering by the steady action of the
pumps far above and beyond their control. An irregular settlement
might overturn the structure. Should the descent of the
caisson be arrested by any solid under
its edge, immediate and judicious action
must be taken. If the obstruction be a
log, it must be cut off outside the edge
and pulled into the chamber. Boulders
must be undermined and often must be
broken up by blasting. The excavation
must be systematic and regular. A constant
danger menaces the lives of these
workers, and the wonderful success with
which they have accomplished what they
have undertaken is entitled to notice and
admiration.</p>

<div class="figright">

<div class="caption">Pier of Hawkesbury Bridge, Australia.</div>
</div>

<p>Another process, which has succeeded
in carrying a foundation to greater depths
than is possible with compressed air, is
by building a crib or caisson, with chambers
entirely open at the top, but having
the alternate ones closed at the bottom
and furnished with cutting edges. These
closed chambers are weighted with stone
or gravel until the structure rests upon
the bottom of the river; the material is
then excavated from the bottom through
the open chambers, by means of dredges,
thus permitting the structure to sink by
its weight to the desired depth. When that depth is reached, the
chambers which have been used for dredging are filled with concrete,
and the masonry is constructed upon the top of this structure.
The use of this system has enabled the engineer to place
foundations deeper than has been accomplished by any other device,
one recently built in Australia being 175 feet below the surface
of the water. The illustrations above and on <a href="#Page_76">page 76</a> show
this method of construction.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<div class="caption">Foundation Crib of the Poughkeepsie Bridge.
<br /><br /></div>
</div>

<p>Even more remarkable than the pneumatic caisson is this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
method of sinking these great foundations. The removal of material
must be made with such systematic regularity that the structure
shall descend evenly
and always maintain
its upright position.
The dredge is handled
and operated entirely
from the surface. The
very idea is startling,
of managing an excavation
more than a
hundred feet below the
operator, entirely by
means of the ropes
which connect with the dredge, and doing it with such delicacy
that the movement of an enormous structure, weighing many tons,
is absolutely controlled. This is one of the latest and most interesting
advances of engineering skill.</p>

<p>While it is true that the avoidance of large expenditure, when
possible, is a mark of the best engineering, yet great structures
often become absolutely necessary in the development of railway
communication. Wide rivers must be crossed, deep valleys must
be spanned, and much study has been given to the best methods
of accomplishing these
results. In the early
history of railways in
Europe substantial
viaducts of brick and
stone masonry were
generally built; and in
this country there are
notable instances of
such constructions.
The approach to the
depot of the Pennsylvania
Railroad, in the city of Philadelphia, is an excellent example.
Each street crossed by the viaduct is spanned by a bold arch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
brick. Upon a
number of our railways there
are heavy masonry arches and culverts,
and at some places these are of a very
interesting character. The arches in
the approach to the bridge over the
Harlem Valley (recently completed) are shown above. They
are of granite, having a span of 60 feet. The illustration shows
also the method of supporting the stone work of such arches during
construction. Braced timbers form what is called the centre,
and support the curved frame of plank upon which the masonry
is built, which, of course, cannot be self-supporting until the keystone
is in place; then the centre is lowered by a loosening of the
wedges which support it, and the stone work of the arch is permitted
to assume its final bearing. It is generally considered that
where it is practicable to construct masonry arches under railways
there is a fair assurance of their permanency, but some engineers
of great experience in railway construction advance the theory that
the constant jar and tremor produced by passing railway trains is
really more destructive to masonry work than has been supposed,

<p>Before referring, however, to examples of truss bridges, a description
should be given of the Britannia Bridge, built by Robert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Stephenson in 1850, over the Menai Straits. This great construction
carries two lines of rails and is built of two square tubes,
side by side, each being continuous, 1,511 feet long, supported at
each extremity and at three intermediate points, and having two
spans of 460 feet each and two spans of 230 feet each. The towers
which support this structure are of very massive masonry, and
rise considerably above the top of the tubes. These tubes are
each 27 feet high and 14 feet 8 inches wide; they are built up of
plate iron, the top and bottom being cellular in construction, and
the sides of a single thickness of iron. The tubes for the long
spans were built on shore and floated to the side of the bridge and
then lifted by hydraulic presses to their final position. The rapid
current, and other considerations, made the erection of false works
for these spans impracticable. The beautiful suspension bridge,
built by Telford in 1820, over the Menai Straits, is only a mile
away from this Britannia Bridge, but, at the time of the construction
of the latter, it was not deemed possible by English engineers
to erect a suspension bridge of sufficient strength and stability to
accommodate railway traffic.</p>

of construction as the Britannia Bridge, but is built only for
a single line of rails; this bridge also was built by Mr. Stephenson,
in 1859. These two structures were enormous works; their
strength is undoubted, but they lack that element of permanent
economy which has been spoken of in this article; their cost was
very great, and the expense of maintenance is also very great. A
very large amount of rust is taken from these tubes every year;
they require very frequent painting, and there are on the Victoria
Bridge 30 acres of iron surface to be thus painted.</p>

<div class="caption">Old Stone Towers of the Niagara Suspension Bridge.</div>
</div>

<p>A remarkable and interesting contrast to these heavy tubes of
iron is the Niagara Falls railway suspension bridge, completed in
March, 1855. The span of this bridge is 821 feet, and the track
is 245 feet above the water surface. It is supported by 4 cables
which rested on the tops of two masonry towers at each end of the
central span, the ends of the cables being carried to and anchored
in the solid rock. The suspended superstructure has two floors,
one above the other, connected together at each side by posts and
truss rods, inclined in such a manner as to form an open trussed
tube, not intended to support the load, but to prevent excessive
undulations. The floors are suspended from the cables by wire
ropes, the upper floor carrying the railroad track, and the lower
forming a foot and carriage way. Each cable has 3,640 iron wires.
This bridge carried successfully a heavy traffic for 26 years; it was
then found that some repairs to the cable were required at the anchorage,
the portions of the cables exposed to the air being in excellent
condition. These repairs were made, and the anchorage
was substantially reinforced. At the same time it was found that
the wooden suspended superstructure was in bad condition, and
this was entirely removed and replaced by a structure of iron, built
and adjusted in such a manner as to secure the best possible results.
For some time it had been noticed that the stone towers
which supported the great cables of the bridge showed evidences
of disintegration at the surface, and a careful engineering examination
in 1885 showed that these towers were in a really dangerous
condition. The reason for this was that the saddles over which
the cables pass on the top of the towers had not the freedom of
motion which was required for the action of the cables, caused by
differences of temperature and by passing loads. These saddles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
had been placed upon rollers but, at some period, cement had been
allowed to be put between these rollers, thus preventing their free
motion. The result was a bending
strain upon the towers which
was too great for the strength
and cohesion of the stone.
A most interesting and successful
feat was accomplished
in the substitution of iron
towers for these stone towers,
without interrupting
the traffic across the bridge.
This was accomplished within
a year or two by building
a skeleton iron tower outside
of the stone tower, and
transferring the cables from the stone to the iron tower by a most
ingenious arrangement of hydraulic jacks. The stone towers were
then removed. Thus, by the renewal of its suspended structure
and the replacing of its towers, the bridge has been given a new
lease of life and is in excellent condition to-day.</p>

<p>This Niagara railway
suspension bridge has
been so long in successful
operation that it is difficult
now to appreciate the general
disbelief in the possibility
of its success as a
railway bridge, when it
was undertaken. It was
projected and executed by
the late John A. Roebling.
Before it was finished, Robert
Stephenson said to him,
"If your bridge succeeds,
mine is a magnificent blunder." The Niagara bridge did succeed.</p>

<div class="caption">Below the Brooklyn Bridge.<br />
From a painting by J. H. Twachtman.</div>
</div>

<p>We are so familiar with the great suspension bridge between
New York and Brooklyn, that only a simple statement of some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
its characteristic features will be given. Its clear span is 1,595½
feet. With its approaches its length is 3,455 feet. The clear
waterway is 135 feet high. The towers rise 272 feet above high
water and extend on the New York side down to rock 78 feet below.
The four suspension cables are of steel wire and support six
parallel steel trusses, thus providing two carriage ways, two lines
of railway, and one elevated footway. The cables are carried to
bearing anchorages in New York and in Brooklyn. The cars on
the bridge are propelled by cables, and the amount of travel is
now so great as to demand some radical changes in the methods
for its accommodation, which a few years ago were supposed to
be ample.</p>

<p>Except under special circumstances of location or length of
span, the truss bridge is a more economical and suitable structure
for railway traffic than a suspension bridge.</p>

<p>The advance from the wood truss to the modern steel structure
has been through a number of stages. Excellent bridges were
built in combinations of wood and iron, and are still advocated
where wood is inexpensive. Then came the use of cast iron for
those portions of the truss subject only to compressive strains,
wrought iron being used for all members liable to tension. Many
bridges of notable spans were built in this way and are still in use.
The form of this combination truss varied with the designs of different
engineers, and the spans extended to over three hundred
feet. The forms bore the names of the designers, and the Fink,
the Bollman, the Pratt, the Whipple, the Post, the Warren, and
others had each their advocates. The substitution of wrought for
cast iron followed, and until quite recently trusses built entirely of
wrought iron have been used for all structures of great span. The
latest step has been made in the use of steel, at first for special
members of a truss and latterly for the whole structure. The art
of railway bridge building has thus, in a comparatively few years,
passed through its age of wood, and then of iron, and now rests in
the application of steel in all its parts.</p>

<p>Two distinct ways of connecting the different parts of a structure
are in common use, riveting and pin connections.</p>

<p>In riveted connections the various parts of the bridge are fastened
at all junctions by overlapping the plates of iron or steel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
inserting rivets into holes punched through all the plates to be
connected. The rivets are so spaced as to insure the best result
as to strength. The pieces of metal are brought together, either
in the shop or at the structure during erection, and the rivets,
which are round pieces of metal with a head formed on one end,
are heated and inserted from one side, being made long enough to
project sufficiently to give the proper amount of metal for forming
the other head. This is done while the rivet is still hot, either by
hammering or by the application of a riveting machine, operated
by steam or hydraulic pressure. Ingenious portable machines are
now manufactured which are hung from the structure during erection
and connected by flexible hose with the steam power, by the
use of which the rivet heads can be formed in place with great
celerity. The connections of plates by rivets of proper dimensions
and properly spaced give great strength and stiffness to such
joints.</p>

<p>In pin connections the members of a structure are assembled
at points of junction and a large iron or steel pin inserted in a pin-hole
running through all the members. This pin is made of such
diameter as to withstand and properly transmit all the strains
brought upon it. Joints made with such pin connections have flexibility,
and the strains and stresses can be calculated with great
precision. Eye-bars are forged pieces of iron or steel, generally
flat, and enlarged at the ends so as to give a proper amount of
metal around the pin-hole or eye, formed in those ends.</p>

<p>Structures connected by pins at their principal junctions have,
of course, many parts in which riveting must be used.</p>

<p>The elements which are distinctively American in our railway
bridges are the concentration of material in few members and the
use of eye-bars and pin connections in place of riveted connections.
The riveted methods are, however, largely used in connection
with the American forms of truss construction.</p>

<div class="caption">Truss Bridge of the Northern Pacific Railway over the Missouri River at Bismarck, Dak.&mdash;Testing the central span.</div>
</div>

<p>An excellent example of an American railway truss bridge is
shown on the opposite page. This structure spans the Missouri
River at its crossing by the Northern Pacific Railroad. It has three
through spans of 400 feet each and two deck spans of 113 feet each.
The bottom chords of the long spans are 50 feet above high water,
which at this place is 1,636 feet above the level of the sea. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
foundations of the masonry
piers were pneumatic
caissons. The trusses of
the through spans, 400
feet long, are 50 feet deep
and 22 feet between centres.
They are divided
into 16 panels of 25 feet
each. The truss is of the
double system Whipple
type, with inclined end
posts. The bridge is proportioned
to carry a train
weighing 2,000 pounds
per lineal foot, preceded
by two locomotives weighing
150,000 pounds in a
length of 50 feet. The
pins connecting the members
of the main truss are
5 inches in diameter.</p>

<p>This bridge is a characteristic
illustration of the
latest type of American
methods. The extreme
simplicity of its lines of
construction, the direct
transfer of the strains arising
from loads, through
the members, to and from
the points where those
strains are concentrated in
the pin connections at the
ends of each member, are
apparent even to the untechnical
eye. The apparent
lightness of construction
arising from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
concentration of the material in so small a number of members,
and the necessarily great height of the truss, give a grace and
elegance to the structure, and suggest bold and fine development
of the theories of mechanics.</p>

<div class="caption">Curved Viaduct, Georgetown, Col.; the Union Pacific crossing its own Line.</div>
</div>

<p>An interesting viaduct is shown in the above illustration, where
the railway crosses its own line on a curved truss.</p>

<p>The truss bridges which have been mentioned as types of the
modern railway bridge are erected by the use of false works of
timber, placed generally upon piling or other suitable foundation,
between the piers or abutments, and made of sufficient strength to
carry each span of the permanent structure until it is completed
and all its parts connected, or, as is technically said, until the span
is swung. Then the false works are removed and the span is left
without intermediate support. But there are places where it
would be impossible or exceedingly expensive to erect any false
works. A structure over a valley of great depth, or over a river
with very rapid current, are instances of such a situation.</p>

<p>A suspension bridge would solve the problem, but in many
cases not satisfactorily. The method adopted by Colonel C. Sha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>ler
Smith at the Kentucky River Bridge [p. 55] shows ingenuity
and boldness worthy of special remark. The Cincinnati Southern
Railroad had here to cross a cañon 1,200 feet wide and 275 feet
deep. The river is subject to freshets every two months, with a
range of 55 feet and a known rise of 40 feet in a single night.
Twenty years before, the towers for a suspension bridge had been
erected at this point. The design adopted for the railroad bridge
was based upon the cantilever principle. The structure has three
spans of 375 feet each, carrying a railway track at a height of 276
feet above the bed of the river. At the time of its construction
this was the highest railway bridge in the world, and it is still the
highest structure of the kind with spans of over 60 feet in length.
The bridge is supported by the bluffs at its ends and by two intermediate
iron piers resting upon bases of stone masonry. Each
iron pier is 177 feet high, and consists of four legs, having a base
of 71½ × 28 feet, and terminating at its top in a turned pin 12
inches in diameter under each of the two trusses. Each iron pier
is a structure complete in itself, with provision for expansion and
contraction in each direction through double roller beds interposed
between it and the masonry, and is braced to withstand a gale of
wind that would blow a loaded freight-train bodily from the bridge.</p>

<p>The trusses were commenced by anchoring them back to the
old towers, and were then built out as cantilevers from each bluff
to a distance of one-half the length of the side spans, and at this
point rested upon temporary wooden supports. Thence they were
again extended as cantilevers until the side spans were completed
and rested upon the iron piers. This cantilever principle is
simply the balancing of a portion of the structure on one side of a
support by the portion on the opposite side of the same support.
Similarly the halves of the middle span were built out from the
piers, meeting with exactness in mid-air. The temporary support
used first at the centre of one side span and then at the other, was
the only scaffolding used in erecting the structure, none whatever
being used for the middle span.</p>

<p>When the junction was made at the centre of the middle span,
the trusses were continuous from bluff to bluff, and, had they been
left in this condition, would have been subjected to constantly
varying strains resulting from the rise and fall of the iron piers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
due to thermal
changes. This
liability was obviated
by cutting
the bottom chords
of the side spans and
converting them into sliding joints
at points 75 feet distant from the
iron piers. This done, the bridge
consists of a continuous girder 525 feet long, covering the middle
span of 375 feet, and projecting as cantilevers for 75 feet beyond
each pier, each cantilever supporting one end of a 300-foot span,
which completes the distance to the bluff on each side.</p>

<div class="center caption">The Niagara Cantilever<br />Bridge in Progress.</div>

<p>A most interesting example of cantilever construction is the railway
bridge built several years ago at Niagara, only a few rods from
the suspension bridge and a short distance below the great falls. It
is shown in the illustrations above and on <a href="#Page_91">page 91</a>. The floor of
the bridge is 239 feet above the surface of the water, which at that
point has a velocity in the centre of 16½ miles per hour and forms
constant whirlpools and eddies near the shores. The total length
of the structure is 910 feet, and the clear span over the river between
the towers is 470 feet. The shore arms of the cantilever,
that is to say, those portions of the structure which extend from
the top of the bank to the top of the tower built from the foot of
the bank, are firmly anchored at their shore ends to a pier built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
upon the solid rock. These shore-arms were constructed on
wooden false works, and serve as balancing weights to the other
or river arms of the lever, which project out over the stream.
These river-arms were built by the addition of metal, piece by
piece, the weight being always more than balanced by the shore-arms.
The separate members of the river-arms were run out on
the top of the completed part and then lowered from the end by
an overhanging travelling derrick, and fastened in place by men
working upon a platform suspended below. This work was continued,
piece by piece, until the river-arm of each cantilever was
complete, and the structure was then finished by connecting these
river-arms by a short truss suspended from them directly over the
centre of the stream. This whole structure was built in eight
months, and is an example both of a bold engineering work and of
the facility with which a pin-connected structure can be erected.
The materials are steel and iron. The prosecution of this work
by men suspended on a platform, hung by ropes from a skeleton
structure projecting, without apparent support, over the rushing
Niagara torrent, was always an interesting and really thrilling
spectacle.</p>

<p>The Lachine Bridge recently built over the St. Lawrence near
Montreal, illustrated below, has certain peculiar features. It has a
total length of 3,514 feet. The two channel spans are each 408 feet
in length and are through spans. The others are deck spans.
Through spans are
those where the train
passes between the
side trusses. Deck
spans are those
where the train
passes over the top
of the structure.
These two channel
spans and the two spans next them form cantilevers, and the channel
spans were built out from the central pier and from the adjacent
flanking spans without the use of false works in either channel.
A novel method of passing from the deck to the through spans has
been used, by curving the top and bottom chords of the channel
spans to connect with the chords of the flanking spans. The material
is steel.</p>

<p>Of entirely different design and principle from all these trusses
are the beautiful steel arches of the St. Louis Bridge [p. 95], the
great work of that remarkable genius, James B. Eads. This
structure spans the Mississippi at St. Louis. Difficult problems
were presented in the study of the design for a permanent bridge
at that point. The river is subject to great changes. The variation
between extreme low and high water has been over 41 feet.
The current runs from 2¾ to 8½ miles per hour. It holds always
much matter in suspension, but the amount so held varies greatly
with the velocity. The very bed of the river is really in constant
motion. Examination by Captain Eads in a diving-bell showed
that there was a moving current of sand at the bottom, of at least
three feet in depth. At low water, the velocity of the stream is
small and the bottom rises. When the velocity increases, a
"scour" results and the river-bed is deepened, sometimes with
amazing rapidity. In winter the river is closed by huge cakes of
ice from the north, which freeze together and form great fields of
ice.</p>

<p>It was decided to be necessary that the foundations should go
to rock, and they were so built. The general plan of the superstructure,
with all its details, was elaborated gradually and carefully,
and the result is a real feat of engineering. There are three
steel arches, the centre one having a span of 520 feet and each
side arch a span of 502 feet. Each span has four parallel arches
or ribs, and each arch is composed of two cylindrical steel tubes,
18 inches in exterior diameter, one acting as the upper and the
other as the lower chord of the arch. The tubes are in sections,
each about twelve feet long, and connected by screw joints. The
thickness of the steel forming the tubes runs from 1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub> to 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches.
These upper and lower tubes are parallel and are 12 feet apart,
connected by a single system of diagonal bracing. The double
tracks of the railroad run through the bridge adjacent to the side
arches at the elevation of the highest point of the lower tube. The
carriage road and footpaths extend the full width of the bridge and
are carried, by braced vertical posts, at an elevation of twenty-three
feet above the railroad. The clear headway is 55 feet above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
ordinary high water. The approaches on each side are masonry
viaducts, and the railway connects with the City Station by a tunnel
nearly a mile in length. The illustration shows vividly the
method of erection of these great tubular ribs. They were built
out from each side of a pier, the weight on one side acting as a
counterpoise for the construction on the other side of the pier.
They were thus gradually and systematically projected over the
river, without support from below, till they met at the middle of
the span, when the last central connecting tube was put in place
by an ingenious mechanical arrangement, and the arch became
self-supporting.</p>

<p>The double arch steel viaduct recently built over the Harlem
Valley in the city of New York [<a href="#Page_96">p. 97</a>] has a marked difference
from the St. Louis arches in the method of construction of the
ribs. These are made up of immense voussoirs of plate steel,
forming sections somewhat analogous to the ring stones of a masonry
arch. These sections are built up in the form of great <span class="large bold">I</span>
beams, the top and bottom of the <span class="large bold">I</span> being made by a number of
parallel steel plates connected by angle pieces with the upright
web, which is a single piece of steel. The vertical height of the
<span class="large bold">I</span> is 13 feet. The span of each of these arches is 510 feet.
There are six such parallel ribs in each span, connected with each
other by bracing. These great ribs rest upon steel pins of 18
inches diameter, placed at the springing of the arch. The arches
rise from massive masonry piers, which extend up to the level of
the floor of the bridge. This floor is supported by vertical posts
from the arches and is a little above the highest point of the rib.
It is 152 feet above the surface of the river&mdash;having an elevation
fifty feet greater than the well-known High Bridge, which spans
the same valley within a quarter of a mile. The approaches to
these steel arches on each side are granite viaducts carried over
a series of stone arches. The whole structure forms a notable
example of engineering construction. It was finished within two
years from the beginning of work upon its foundations, the energy
of its builders being worthy of special commendation.</p>

<p>In providing for the rapid transit of passengers in great cities
the two types of construction successfully adopted are represented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
by the New York Elevated
and the London
Underground railways.
The New York Elevated
is a continuous metal viaduct,
supported on columns
varying in height so
as to secure easy grades.
The details of construction
differ greatly at various
parts of the elevated lines,
those more recently built
being able to carry much
heavier trains than the
earlier portions. The
roads have been very successful
in providing the
facilities for transit so absolutely
necessary in New
York. The citizens of
that city are alive to the
present necessity of adding
very soon to those
facilities, and it is now
only a question of the
best method to be adopted
to secure the largest
results in a permanent
manner.</p>

<p>The London Underground
road has also been
very successful. Its construction
was a formidable
undertaking. Its tunnels
are not only under streets
but under heavy buildings.
Its daily traffic is enormous.
The difficult ques<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>tion
in its management is, as in all long tunnels, that of ventilation,
but modern science will surely solve that, as it does so many
other problems connected with the active life of man.</p>

<p>Many broad questions of general policy, and innumerable matters
of detail are involved in the development of railway engineering.
In the determination, for instance, of the location, the relations
of cost and construction to future business, the possibilities
of extensions and connections, the best points for settlements and
industrial enterprises, the merits and defects of alternative routes
must be weighed and decided.</p>

<p>Where structures are to be built, the amount and delicacy of
detail requisite in their design and execution can hardly be described.
Final pressures upon foundations must be ascertained
and provided for. Accurate calculations of strains and stresses,
involving the application of difficult processes and mechanical theo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>ries,
must be made. The adjustment of every part must be secured
with reference to its future duty. Strength and safety must
be assured and economy not forgotten. Every contingency must,
if possible, be anticipated, while the emergencies which arise during
every great construction demand constant watchfulness and
prompt and accurate decision.</p>

<p>The financial success of the largest enterprises rests upon such
practical application of theory and experience. Even more weighty
still is the fact that the safety of thousands of human lives depends
daily upon the permanency and stability of railway structures.
Such are some of the deep responsibilities which are involved in
the active work of the Civil Engineer.</p>

<p class="p1x drop-cap">Among the readers of this volume there
will be some who have reached the summit
of the "divide" which separates the
spring and summer of life from its autumn
and winter, and whose first information about
railroads was received from Peter Parley's "First
Book of History," which was used as a schoolbook
forty or fifty years ago. In his chapter on Maryland,
he says:</p>

<div class="blockquoty">

<p>But the most curious thing at Baltimore is the railroad. I must tell you that there is
a great trade between Baltimore and the States west of the Alleghany Mountains. The
western people buy a great many goods at Baltimore, and send in return a great deal of
western produce. There is, therefore, a vast deal of travelling back and forth, and hundreds
of teams are constantly occupied in transporting goods and produce to and from
market.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Now, in order to carry on all this business more easily, the people are building what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
is called a railroad. This consists of iron bars laid along the ground, and made fast, so
that carriages with small wheels may run along upon them with facility. In this way,
one horse will be able to draw as much as ten horses on a common road. A part of this
railroad is already done, and if you choose to take a ride upon it, you can do so. You
will mount a car something like a stage, and then you will be drawn along by two horses,
at the rate of twelve miles an hour.</p></div>

<p>This engraving and description, made for children, more than
fifty years ago, will give some idea of the state of the art of railroading
at that time; and it is
a remarkable fact that the present
wonderful development and
the improvements in railroads
and their equipments in this
country have been made during
the lives of persons still living.</p>

<p>In the latter part of 1827,
the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal
Company put the Carbondale
Railroad under construction.
The road extends from the head of the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal
at Honesdale, Pa., to the coal mines belonging to the Delaware &amp;
Hudson Canal Company at Carbondale, a distance of about sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
miles. This line was opened, probably in 1829, and was operated
partly by stationary engines, and partly by horses. The road is
noted chiefly for being the one on which a locomotive was first
used in this country.
This was the "Stourbridge
Lion," which
was built in England
under the direction of
Mr. Horatio Allen,
who afterward was
president of the Novelty
Works in New York, and who is still (1889) living near
New York at the ripe age of eighty-seven. Before the road
was opened, he had been a civil engineer on the Carbondale
line. In 1828 Mr. Allen went to England, the only place where
a locomotive was then in daily operation, to study the subject
in all its practical details. Before leaving this country he was
intrusted by the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Company with the
commission to have rails made for that line, and to have three
locomotives built on plans to be decided by him when in England.
This, it must be remembered, was before the celebrated
trial of the "Rocket" on the Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway,
which was not made until 1829. Previous to that trial, it
had not been decided what type of boiler was the best for
locomotives. The result of Mr. Allen's investigations was to
produce in his mind a decided confidence in the multitubular
boiler which is now universally used for locomotives. Other
persons of experience recommended a boiler with small riveted
flues of as small diameter as could be riveted. An order was
therefore given to Messrs. Foster, Rastrick &amp; Co., at Stourbridge,
for one engine whose boiler was to have riveted flues of
comparatively large size, and another order was given to Messrs.
Stephenson &amp; Co., of Newcastle-on-Tyne, for two locomotives
with boilers having small tubes. The engine built by Foster,
Rastrick &amp; Co. was named the "Stourbridge Lion." It was sent
to this country and was tried at Honesdale, Pa., on August 9,
1829. On its trial trip it was managed by Mr. Allen, to whom
belongs the distinction of having run the first locomotive that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
was ever used in this country. In 1884 he wrote the following
account of this trip:</p>

<div class="blockquoty">

<p>When the time came, and the steam was of the right pressure, and all was ready,
I took my position on the platform of the locomotive alone, and with my hand on the
throttle-valve handle said: "If there is any danger in this ride it is not necessary that
the life and limbs of more than one should be subjected to that danger."</p>

<p>The locomotive, having no train behind it, answered at once to the movement of the
hand; ... soon the straight line was run over, the curve was reached and passed
before there was time to think as to its not being passed safely, and soon I was out of
sight in the three miles' ride alone in the woods of Pennsylvania. I had never run a
locomotive nor any other engine before; I have never run one since.</p></div>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_103.jpg" width="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Horatio Allen.</div>
</div>

<p>The two engines contracted for with Messrs. Stephenson &amp;
Co. were made by them, and Mr. Allen has informed the writer
that they were built on substantially
the same plans that were
afterward embodied in the famous
"Rocket." They were shipped
to New York and for a time were
stored in an iron warehouse on
the east side of the city, where
they were exhibited to the public.
They were never sent to the Delaware
&amp; Hudson Canal Company's
road, and it is not now
known whatever became of them.
If they had been put to work on
their arrival here the use of engines
of the "Rocket" type would have been anticipated on this
side the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The first railroad which was undertaken for the transportation
of freight and passengers in this country, on a comprehensive
scale, was the Baltimore &amp; Ohio. Its construction was begun in
1828. The laying of rails was commenced in 1829, and in May,
1830, the first section of fifteen miles from Baltimore to Ellicott's
Mills was opened. It was probably about this time that the animated
sketch of the car given by Peter Parley was made. From
1830 to 1835 many lines were projected, and at the end of that
year there were over a thousand miles of road in use.</p>

<p>Whether the motive power on these roads should be horses or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
steam was for a long time an open question. The celebrated trial
of locomotives on the Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway, in England,
was made in 1829. Reports of these trials, and of the use of locomotive
engines on the Stockton &amp; Darlington line, were published
in this country, and, as Mr. Charles Francis Adams says, "The
country, therefore, was not only ripe to accept the results of the
Rainhill contest, but it was anticipating them with eager hope."
In 1829 Mr. Horatio Allen, who had been
in England the year before to learn all that
could then be learned about steam locomotion,
reported to the South Carolina Railway
Company in favor of steam instead of horse
power for that line. The basis of that report,
he says, "Was on the broad ground
that in the future there was no reason to
expect any material improvement in the
breed of horses, while, in my judgment, the
man was not living who knew what the breed of locomotives was
to place at command."</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_104.jpg" width="225" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;Peter Cooper's Locomotive,
1830.</div>
</div>

<p>As early as 1829 and 1830, Peter Cooper experimented with a
little locomotive on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad (Fig. 4). At
a meeting of the Master Mechanics' Association in New York, in
1875&mdash;at the Institute which bears his name&mdash;he related with great
glee how on the trial trip he had beaten a gray horse, attached to
another car. The coincidence that one of Peter Parley's horses is
a gray one might lead to the inference that it was the same horse
that Peter Cooper beat, a deduction which perhaps has as sound a
basis to rest on as many historical conclusions of more importance.</p>

<p>The undeveloped condition of the art of machine construction
at that time is indicated by the fact that the flues of the boiler of
this engine were made of gun-barrels, which were the only tubes
that could then be obtained for the purpose. The boiler itself is
described as about the size of a flour-barrel. The whole machine
was no larger than a hand-car of the present day.</p>

<div class="figright">

<div class="caption">Fig. 5.&mdash;"South Carolina," 1831,<br />and Plan of its Running Gear.</div>
</div>

<p>In the same year that Peter Cooper built his engine, the South
Carolina Railway Company had a locomotive, called the "Best
Friend," built at the West Point Foundry for its line. In 1831 this
company had another engine, the "South Carolina" (Fig. 5),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
which was designed by Mr. Horatio Allen, built at the same shop.
It was remarkable in having eight wheels, which were arranged in
two trucks. One pair of driving-wheels, <em>D D</em> and <em>D′ D′</em>, and a
pair of leading-wheels, <em>L L</em>
and <em>L′ L′</em>, were attached to
frames, <em>c d e f</em> and <em>g h i j</em>,
which were connected to the
boiler by kingbolts, <em>K K′</em>,
about which the trucks could
turn. Each pair of driving-wheels
had one cylinder, <em>C
C′</em>. These were in the middle
of the engine and were
connected to cranks on the
axles <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>.</p>

<p>The "De Witt Clinton"
(Fig. 6) was built for the Mohawk &amp; Hudson Railroad, and was
the third locomotive made by the West Point Foundry Association.
The first excursion trip was made with passengers from Albany to
Schenectady, August 9, 1831. This is the engine shown in the
silhouette engraving of the "first<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> railroad train in America"
which in recent years has been so widely distributed as an advertisement.</p>

<img src="images/i_105b.jpg" width="200" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 6.&mdash;The "De Witt Clinton," 1831.</div>
</div>

<p>In 1831 the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company offered a
premium of $4,000 "for the most approved engine which shall be
delivered for trial upon the road on or
before the 1st of June, 1831; and $3,500
for the engine which shall be adjudged
the next best." The requirements were
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquoty">

<p>The engine, when in operation, must not exceed three
and one-half tons weight, and must, on a level road, be
capable of drawing day by day fifteen tons, inclusive
of the weight of wagons, fifteen miles per hour.</p></div>

<p>In pursuance of this call upon American genius, three locomotives
were produced, but only one of these was made to answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
any useful purpose. This engine, the "York," was built at York,
Pa., and was brought to Baltimore over the turnpike on wagons.
It was built by Davis &amp; Gartner, and was designed by Phineas
Davis, of that firm, whose trade and business was that of a watch
and clock maker. After undergoing certain modifications, it was
found capable of performing what was required by the company.
After thoroughly testing this engine, Mr. Davis built others, which
were the progenitors of the "grasshopper" engines (Fig. 7) which
were used for so many years on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad.
It is a remarkable fact that three of these are still in use on that
road, and have been in continuous service for over fifty years.
Probably there is no locomotive in existence which has had so
long an <em>active</em> life.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 7.&mdash;"Grasshopper" Locomotive. (From an old photograph.)</div>
</div>

<p>In August, 1831, the locomotive "John Bull," which was built
by George &amp; Robert Stephenson &amp; Company, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
was received in Philadelphia, for the Camden &amp; Amboy
Railroad &amp; Transportation Company. This is the old engine
which was exhibited by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company at
the Centennial Exhibition in 1876. After the arrival of the "John
Bull" a very considerable number of locomotives which were built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
by the Stephensons were imported from England. Most of them
were probably of what was known as the "Planet" class (Fig. 8),
which was a form of engine that succeeded the famous "Rocket."</p>

<p>The following quotation is from "The Early History of Locomotives
in this Country," issued by the Rogers Locomotive &amp;
Machine Works:</p>

<div class="blockquoty">

<p>These locomotives, which were imported from England, doubtless to a very considerable
extent, furnished the types and patterns from which those which were afterward built
here were fashioned. But American designs very soon began to depart from their British
prototypes, and a process of adaptation to the existing conditions of the railroads in this
country followed, which afterward "differentiated" the American locomotives more and
more from those built in Great Britain. A marked feature of difference between American
and English locomotives has been the use of a "truck" under the former.</p></div>

<p>In all of the locomotives which have been illustrated, excepting
the "South Carolina," the axles were held by the frames so that
the former were always parallel to each other. In going around
curves, therefore, there was somewhat the same difficulty that there
would be in turning a corner with an ordinary wagon if both its
axles were held parallel, and the
front one could not turn on the
kingbolt. The plan of the wheels
and running gear of the "South
Carolina" shows the position that
they assumed on a curved track
(Fig. 5). It will be seen that, by
reason of their connection to the
boiler by kingbolts, <em>K K′</em>, the
two pairs of wheels could adjust
themselves to the curvature of
the rails. This principle was afterward applied to cars, and nearly
all the rolling-stock in this country is now constructed on this plan,
which was proposed by Mr. Allen in a report dated May 16, 1831,
made to the South Carolina Canal &amp; Railroad Company; and an
engine constructed on this principle was completed the same year.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the year 1831 the late John B. Jervis invented
what he called "a new plan of frame, with a bearing-carriage
for a locomotive engine," for the use of the Mohawk &amp; Hudson
Railroad. Jervis's engine is shown by Figure 9. In a letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
published in the <cite>American Railroad Journal</cite> of July 27, 1833, he
described the objects aimed at in the use of the truck as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquoty">

<p>The leading objects I had in view, in the general arrangement of the plan of the engine,
did not contemplate any improvement in the power over those heretofore constructed
by Stephenson &amp; Company,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> but to make an engine that would be better
adapted to railroads of less strength than
are common in England; that would travel
with more ease to itself and to the rail on
curved roads; that would be less affected
by inequalities of the rail, than is attained
by the arrangement in the most approved
engines.</p></div>

Running Gear.</div>
</div>

<p>In Jervis's locomotive the
main driving-axle, <em>A</em>, shown in
the plan of the wheels and running
gear, was rigidly attached
to the engine-frame, <em>a b c d</em>, and
only one truck, or "bearing-carriage,"
<em>e f g h</em>, consisting of the
two pairs of small wheels attached
to a frame, was used. This was connected to the main
engine-frame by a kingbolt, <em>K</em>, as in Allen's engine.</p>

<p>The position of its wheels on a curve, and the capacity of the
truck, or "bearing-carriage," to adapt itself to the sinuosities of
the track are shown in the plan. The effectiveness of the single
truck for locomotives, in accomplishing what Mr. Jervis intended it
for, was at once recognized, and its almost general adoption on
American locomotives followed.</p>

<p>In 1834, Ross Winans, of Baltimore, patented the application
of the principle which Mr. Allen had proposed and adopted for
locomotives "to passenger and other cars." He afterward brought
a number of actions at law against railroads for infringement of his
patent, which was a subject of legal controversy for twenty years.
Winans claimed that his invention originated as far back as 1831,
and was completed and reduced to practice in 1834. The dispute
was finally carried to the Supreme Court of the United States, and
was decided against the plaintiff, after an expenditure of as much
as $200,000 by both sides. It involved the principle on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
nearly all cars in this country are now and were then built; and,
as one of the counsel for the defendants has said, "It was at one
time a question of millions, to be assured by a verdict of a jury."</p>

<p>In 1836, Henry R. Campbell, of Philadelphia, patented the use
of two pairs of driving-wheels and a truck, as shown in Figure 10.
The driving-wheels were coupled by rods, as may be seen below.
This plan has since been so generally adopted in this country that
it is now known as the "American type" of locomotive, and is the
one almost universally used here for passenger, and to a considerable
extent for freight, service. An example of a modern locomotive
of this type is represented by Figure 11.</p>

<p>From these comparatively small beginnings, the magnificent
equipment of our railroads has grown. From Peter Cooper's locomotive,
which weighed less than a ton, with a boiler the size of a
flour-barrel, and which had difficulty in beating a gray horse, we now
have locomotives which will easily run sixty and can exceed seventy
miles an hour, and others which weigh seventy-five tons and over.
A comparison of the engraving of Peter Cooper's engine with that
of the modern standard express passenger locomotive (Fig. 11)
shows vividly the progress which has been made since that first
experiment was tried&mdash;little more than half a century ago. In that
period there have been many modifications in the design of locomotives
to adapt them to the changed conditions of the various
kinds of traffic of to-day. An
express train travelling at a high
rate of speed requires a locomotive
very different from one which
is designed for handling heavy
freight trains up steep mountain grades.
A special class of engines
is built for light trains
making frequent stops, as on the
elevated railroads in New York,
and those provided for suburban
traffic (Fig. 12)&mdash;and still others for street railroads (Fig. 13), for
switching cars at stations (Fig. 14), etc. [<a href="#Page_110">Pp. 110</a> and <a href="#Page_113">113</a>]. The process
of differentiation has gone on until there are now as many different
kinds of these machines as there are breeds of dogs or horses.</p>

<p>Nearly all the early locomotives had only four wheels. In some
cases one pair alone was used to drive the engine, and in others
the two pairs were coupled together, so that the adhesion of all
four could be utilized to draw loads. The four-wheeled type is
still used a great deal for moving cars at stations, and other purposes
where the speed is comparatively slow. But to run around
sharp curves the wheels of such engines must be placed near together,
just as they are under an ordinary street-car. This makes
the wheel-base very short, and such engines are therefore very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
unsteady at high speeds, so that they are unsuited for any excepting
slow service. They have the advantage, though, that the whole
weight of the machine may be carried on the driving-wheels, and
can thus be useful for increasing their friction, or adhesion to the
rails. This gives such engines an advantage for starting and moving
heavy trains, at stations or elsewhere, which is the kind of service
in which they are usually employed.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 14.&mdash;Four-wheeled Switching Locomotive. By the Baldwin Locomotive Works, Philadelphia.</div>
</div>

<p>If the front end of the engine is carried on a truck, as in Campbell's
plan (Fig. 10)&mdash;which is the one that has been very generally
adopted in this country&mdash;the wheel-base can be extended and at the
same time the front wheels can adjust themselves to the curvature
of the track. This gives the running-gear lateral flexibility. But
as the tractive power of a locomotive is dependent upon the friction,
or adhesion of the wheels to the rails, it is of the utmost importance
that the pressure of the wheels on the rails should be uniform.
For this reason the wheels must be able to adjust themselves
to the vertical as well as the horizontal inequalities of the
track.</p>

<p>Figure 15 shows the driving-wheels, axles, journal-boxes, and
part of the frame and springs of an American type of engine&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
circumference of the wheels only being shown. The axles <em>A A</em>
each <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'have  ournal-boxes'">have journal-boxes</ins> or bearings, <em>B B</em>, in which they turn.
These boxes
are held between
the jaws
<em>J J J J</em> of the
frames, and can
slide vertically
in the spaces <em>c
c c c</em> between
the jaws. The
frames are suspended on springs, <em>S S</em>, which bear on the boxes <em>B B</em>.
The vertical motion of the boxes and the flexibility of the springs
allow the wheels to adjust themselves to some extent to the unevenness
of the track. But, in order to distribute the weight equally
on the two wheels, the springs <em>S S</em> on each side of the engine
are connected together by an equalizing lever, <em>E E</em>. These levers
each have a fulcrum, <em>F</em>, in the middle, and are connected by iron
straps or hangers, <em>h h</em>, to the springs. It is evident that any strain
or tension on one spring is transferred by the equalizing lever to
the other spring, and thus the weight is equalized on both wheels.</p>

<p>But to give perfect vertical adjustment of such an engine to the
track, still another provision must be made. Everyone has observed
that a three-legged stool will always stand firm on any surface,
no matter how irregular, but one with four legs will not.
Now if the back end of a locomotive should rest on the fulcrums
of the equalizing levers, as shown in Figure 15, and the front end
should rest on the two sides of the truck, it would be in the condition
of the four legged stool. Therefore, instead of resting on
the two sides of the truck, locomotives are made to bear on the
centre of it, so that they are carried on it and on the two fulcrums
of the equalizing levers, which gives the machine the adjustability
due to the three-legged principle. When more than four driving-wheels
are used the springs are connected together by equalizing
levers, as shown in Figure 29 (<a href="#Page_124">p. 124</a>), which represents a consolidation
engine as it appears before the wheels are put under it.</p>

<p>Having a vehicle which is adapted to running on a railroad track,
it remains to supply the motive power. This, in all but some very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
few exceptional cases, is the expansive power of steam. What the
infant electricity has in store for us it would be rash to predict, but
for locomotives its steps have been thus far weak and uncertain,
and when we want a giant of steel or a race-horse of iron our only
sure reliance is steam. This is the breath of life to the locomotive,
which is inhaled and exhaled to and from the cylinders, which act
as lungs, while the boiler fulfils functions analogous to the digestive
organs of an animal. A locomotive is as dependent on the action
of its boiler for its capacity for doing work as a human being on that
of his stomach. The mechanical appliances of the one and the
mental and physical equipment of the other are nugatory without a
good digestive apparatus.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 16.&mdash;Longitudinal Section of a Locomotive Boiler.<br />
Fig. 17.&mdash;Transverse Section.</div>
</div>

<p>A locomotive boiler consists of a rectangular fireplace or fire-box,
as shown at <em>A</em>, in Figure 16, which is a longitudinal section, and
Figure 17 a transverse section through the fire-box. The fire-box is
connected with the smoke-box <em>B</em> by a large number of small tubes,
<em>a a</em>, through which the smoke and products of combustion pass from
the fire-box to the smoke-box, and from the latter they escape up
the chimney <em>D</em>. The fire-box and tubes are all surrounded with
water, so that as much surface as possible is exposed to the action
of the fire. This is essential on account of the large amount of
water which must be evaporated in such boilers. To create a
strong draught, the steam which is exhausted from the cylinders
is discharged up the chimney through pipes, and escapes at <em>e</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
This produces a partial vacuum in the smoke-box, which causes a
current of air to flow through the fire on the grate, into the fire-box,
through the tubes, and thence to the smoke-box and up the chimney.
Probably many readers have noticed, that of late years the
smoke-boxes of locomotives have been extended forward in front
of the chimneys. This has been done to give room for deflectors
and wire netting inside to arrest sparks and cinders, which are collected
in the extended front and are removed by a door or spout,
<em>L</em>, below.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 18.&mdash;Rudimentary Injector.</div>
</div>

<p>To get the water into the boiler against the pressure of steam
a very curious instrument, called an injector, has been devised.
Formerly force-pumps were used, but these are now being abandoned.
The illustration (Fig. 18) shows what may be called a rudimentary
injector. <em>B</em> is a boiler and <em>E</em> a conical tube open at its
lower end&mdash;and connected to a water-supply tank by a pipe, <em>C</em>. A
pipe, <em>A</em>, is connected with the steam-space of the boiler and terminates
in a contracted mouth, <em>F</em>, inside of the cone <em>E</em>. If steam is
admitted to <em>A</em>, it flows through the pipe and escapes at <em>F</em>. In doing
so it produces a partial vacuum in <em>E</em>, and water is consequently
drawn up the pipe <em>C</em> from the tank. The current of steam now
carries with it the water, and they
escape at <em>G</em>. After flowing for a
few seconds the water has a high
velocity and the steam, mingling
with the water, is condensed.
The momentum of the water soon
becomes sufficient to force the
valve <em>H</em> down against the pressure
below it, and the jet of water
then flows continuously into the
boiler. A very curious phenomenon
of this somewhat mysterious
instrument is that if steam of a low pressure is taken from one boiler
it will force water into another against a higher pressure. Figure
19 is a section of an actual injector used on locomotives.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_117.jpg" width="175" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 19.&mdash;Injector used on<br />Locomotives.</div>
</div>

<p>Having explained how the steam is generated, it remains to
show how it propels a locomotive. It does this very much as a
person on a bicycle propels it&mdash;that is, by means of two cranks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the wheels are made to revolve, and the latter must then either slip
or the vehicle will move. In a locomotive the driving-wheels are
turned by means of two cylinders and pistons, which are connected
by rods to the cranks attached to the driving-wheels
or axles. These cranks are placed at
right angles to each other, so that when one
of them is at the "dead-point" the piston
connected with the other can exert its maximum
power to rotate the wheels. This enables
the locomotive to start with the pistons
in any position; whereas, if one cylinder only
was used it would be impossible to turn the
wheels if the crank should stop at one of its
dead-points.</p>

<p>It will probably interest a good many
readers to know how the steam gets into the
cylinders and moves the pistons and then
gets out again, and how a locomotive is made
to run either backward or forward at pleasure.</p>

<p>Figure 20 (<a href="#Page_118">p. 118</a>) shows a section of a
cylinder, <em>A A′</em>, with the piston <em>B</em> and piston
rod <em>R</em>. The cylinder has two passages, <em>c c</em> and
<em>d d</em>, which connect its ends with a box, <em>U</em>, called
a steam-chest, to which steam is admitted
from the boiler by a pipe, <em>J</em>. The two passages <em>c</em> and <em>d</em> have
another one, <em>g</em>, between them, which is connected with the chimney.
These passages are covered by a slide-valve, <em>V</em>, which
moves back and forth in the steam-chest, alternately uncovering the
openings <em>c</em> and <em>d</em>. When the valve is in the position shown in Figure
20, obviously steam can flow into the front end <em>A</em> of the cylinder
through the passage <em>c</em>, as indicated by the darts. The valve has a
cavity, <em>H</em>, underneath it. When this cavity is over the passage <em>d</em>
and <em>g</em>, it is plain that the steam in the back end <em>A′</em> of the cylinder
can flow through <em>d</em> and <em>g</em> and then escape up the chimney. Under
these circumstances the steam in the front end <em>A</em> of the cylinder
will force the piston <em>B</em> to the back end. When it reaches the back
end of the cylinder the valve is moved into the position shown in
Figure 21, and steam can then enter <em>d</em> and will fill the back end <em>A′</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
while that in the front end escapes through <em>c</em> and <em>g</em>. The piston
is then forced to the front end by the pressure of the steam behind
it. It will thus be seen that the steam enters and escapes to and
from the cylinder through the
same openings.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_118a.jpg" width="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Figs. 20 (above) and 21.&mdash;Sections of a<br />Locomotive Cylinder.</div>
</div>

<p>From what has been said it
is obvious, too, that every time
the piston moves from one end
of the cylinder to the other the
valve must also be moved back
and forth in the steam-chest.
This is done by what is called
an eccentric.</p>

<p>An "eccentric" is a disk or
wheel (Fig. 22) with a hole, <em>S</em>,
the size of the axle of the locomotive
to which it is attached.
The centre <em>n</em> of the outside periphery
of the eccentric is some
distance from <em>S</em>, the centre of the shaft. A metal ring, <em>K K</em> (Fig. 23),
made in two halves, embraces the eccentric, and the latter revolves inside
of this ring. A rod, <em>L</em>, is attached to the strap, and is connected
with the valve so that the motion of the eccentric is communicated
to it. It is obvious that if the eccentric
revolves it will impart a
reciprocating motion to the rod
<em>L</em>, which is communicated to the
valve.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_118b.jpg" width="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 22.&mdash;Eccentric.<br />
Fig. 23.&mdash;Eccentric and Strap.</div>
</div>

<p>If properly adjusted on the
axle the eccentric will run the
engine in one direction. To run
the opposite way another eccentric
must be provided. Therefore
locomotives always have two eccentrics
for each cylinder. These, <em>J</em> and <em>K</em>, are shown in Figure 24,
which represents the "valve-gear" of a locomotive. <em>S</em> is a section
of the main driving-axle, to which the eccentrics are attached by
keys or screws. <em>C</em> is the eccentric rod of the forward-motion ec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>centric
and <em>D</em> that of the one for running backward. As a locomotive
must be run either backward or forward, and, as the one eccentric
moves the valve to run forward and the other to run
backward, we must be able to connect or disconnect the rods to
and from the valve at will. The eccentric
rods of the early locomotives had hooks on
the ends by which they were attached to or
detached from suitable pins connected with
the valves. But these hooks were very uncertain
in their action and therefore were
abandoned, and now what is known as the
"link-motion" is almost universally used for the valve-gear of locomotives.
It consists of a "link" (<em>a b</em>, Fig. 24) which has a curved
opening or slot, <em>k</em>, in it in which a block, <em>B</em>, fits accurately, so that
it can slide from end to end of the link. This block has a hole
bored in the middle which receives a pin, <em>c</em>, which is attached to
the end of the arm <em>N</em> of the "rocker" <em>M O N</em>. The rocker has a
shaft, <em>O</em>, which can turn in a suitable bearing, and two arms, <em>M</em> and
<em>N</em>; the latter, as explained, is connected to the link by the pin <em>c</em>
and block <em>B</em>. The upper arm <em>M</em> has another pin, <em>V</em>, on its end,
which is connected by a rod, <em>v V</em>, to the main slide-valve <em>V</em>. The
rocker-arms, as will be seen, can vibrate about the shaft <em>O</em>.</p>

<p>It is plain that, by moving the upper end of the reverse lever,
the link <em>a b</em> can be raised up or lowered at will. When the link is
down, or in the position represented in the engraving, the forward
eccentric rod imparts its motion to the block <em>B</em>, pin <em>c</em>, and thence to
the rocker and valve, and the engine will run forward. If, however,
the reverse lever is thrown back into the position indicated by the
dotted line <em>J I</em>, the link would then be raised up so that the end <em>e</em>
of the backward-motion rod would be opposite to the block <em>B</em> and
pin <em>c</em> and would communicate its motion to the rocker and valve,
and the wheels would then be turned backward instead of forward.
It will thus be seen how the movement of the reverse lever effects
the reversal of the engine.</p>

<p>A locomotive is started by admitting steam to the cylinders
by means of what is called the "throttle-valve." This is usually
placed in the upper part of the boiler at <em>T</em> (Fig. 16). The valve
is worked by a lever at <em>l</em>, which is also shown at 14, 14′ (Fig. 36).
The steam is conveyed to the cylinders by a pipe (<em>s</em>, Fig. 16,
p. 115).</p>

<p>If steam is admitted to the cylinders and the wheels are turned,
one of two results must follow: either the locomotive will move
backward or forward according to the direction of revolution, or
the wheels will slip, as they often do, on the rails. That is, if the
resistance of the cars or train is less than the friction or "adhesion"
of the wheels on the rails, the engine and train will be moved; if
the adhesion is less than the resistance the wheels will turn without
moving the train.</p>

<p>The capacity of a locomotive to draw loads is therefore dependent
on the adhesion, and this is in proportion to the weight or
pressure of the driving-wheels on the rails. The adhesion also
varies somewhat with the weather and the condition of the wheels
and rails. In ordinary weather it is equal to about one-fifth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
weight which bears on the track; when perfectly dry, if the rails
are clean, it is about one-fourth, and with the rails sanded about
one-third. In damp or frosty weather the adhesion is often considerably
less than a fifth.</p>

<p>It would, then, seem as though all that is needed to increase
the capacity of a locomotive to draw loads would be to add to the
weight on its driving-wheels, and provide engine-power sufficient
to turn them&mdash;which is true. But it has been found that if the
weight on the wheels is excessive both the wheels and rails will be
injured. Even when they are all made of steel, they are crushed
out of shape or are rapidly worn if the loads are too great. The
weight which rails will carry without being injured depends somewhat
on their size or weight, but ordinarily from 12,000 to 16,000
pounds per wheel is about the greatest load which they should
carry.</p>

<p>For these reasons, when the capacity of a locomotive must be
increased beyond a limit indicated by these data, one or more ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>ditional
pairs of driving-wheels must be used. Thus, if a more
powerful engine was required than that shown in Figure 14 (<a href="#Page_113">p. 113</a>),
another pair of wheels would be added, as shown in Figures 26,
27, and 28. Or, if you wanted a more powerful engine than these,
still another pair of driving-wheels would be provided, as shown in
Figure 30. In this way the Mogul, ten-wheeled and consolidation
engines have been developed from that shown in Figure 14. The
Mogul locomotive (Fig. 27) has three pairs of driving-wheels, but
only one pair of truck-wheels. The engravings shown in Figures
30 and 31 represent consolidation and decapod types of engines
which have four and five pairs of driving-wheels.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 26.&mdash;Six-wheeled Switching Locomotive. By the Schenectady Locomotive Works.</div>
</div>

<p>From the illustrations, Figures 28, 30, and 31, it will be seen
that when so many wheels are used, even if they are of small diameter,
the wheel-base must necessarily be long, so that a limit is very
soon reached beyond which the number of driving-wheels cannot
be increased.</p>

<p>Improvements in the processes of manufacturing steel, which
resulted in the general use of that material for rails and tires, have
made it possible to nearly double the weight which was carried on
each wheel when they were made of iron. The weight of rails
has also been very much increased since they were first made of
steel. Twenty or twenty-five years ago iron rails weighing 56
pounds per yard were about the heaviest that were laid in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
country. Now steel rails weighing 72 pounds are commonly used,
and some weighing 85 pounds have been laid on American roads,
and others weighing 100 pounds have been laid on the Continent
of Europe.</p>

<p>Of late years urban and suburban traffic has created a demand
for a class of locomotives especially adapted to that kind of service.
One of the conditions of that traffic is that trains must stop and
start often, and therefore, to "make fast time," it is essential to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
start quickly. Few persons realize the great amount of force which
must be exerted to start any object suddenly. A cannon-ball, for
example, will fall through 16 feet in a second with no other resistance
than the atmosphere. The impelling force in that case is the
weight of the ball. If we want it to fall 32 feet during the first
second, the force exerted on it must be equal to double its weight,
and for higher speeds the increase of force must be in the same
proportion. This law applies to the movement of trains. To start
in half the time, double the force must be exerted. For this reason,
trains which start and stop often require engines with a great deal
of weight on the driving-wheels. In accordance with these conditions
a class of engines has been designed which carry all, or nearly
all, the weight of the boiler and machinery, and sometimes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
water and fuel, on the driving-wheels. For suburban traffic, the
speed between stops must often be quite rapid, and consequently
the engine must have a long wheel-base for steadiness, as well as
considerable weight on the wheels for adhesion. Four-wheeled
engines (Fig. 14) have all their weight on the driving-wheels, but
the wheel-base is short.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 32.&mdash;"Forney" Tank Locomotive. By the Rogers Locomotive<br />and Machine
Works, Paterson, N. J.</div>
</div>

<p>To combine the two features, engines have been built with the
driving-wheels and axles arranged as in Figure 32. The frames are
then extended backward, and the water-tank and fuel are placed on
top of the frames, and their weight is carried by a truck underneath.
This arrangement leaves the whole weight of the boiler and machinery
on the driving-wheels, and at the same time gives a long
wheel-base for steadiness. This plan of engine was patented by
the author of this article in 1866, and has come into very general
use&mdash;since the expiration of the patent. In some cases a two-wheeled
truck is added at the opposite end, as shown in Figure 33.
For street railroads, in which the speed is necessarily slow, engines
such as Figure 13 (<a href="#Page_110">p. 110</a>) are used. To hide the machine from
view, and also to give sufficient room inside, they are enclosed in
a cab large enough to cover the whole machine.</p>

<p>The size and weight of locomotives have steadily been increased
ever since they were first used, and there is little reason for thinking
that they have yet reached a limit, although it seems probable
that some material change of design is impending which will permit
of better proportions of the parts or organs of the larger sizes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
The decapod engines built at the Baldwin Locomotive Works, in
Philadelphia, for the Northern Pacific Railroad, weigh in working
order 148,000 pounds. This gives a weight of 13,300 pounds on
each driving-wheel. Some ten-wheeled passenger engines, built at
the Schenectady Locomotive Works for the Michigan Central Railroad,
weigh 118,000 pounds, and have 15,666 pounds on each driving-wheel.
Some recent eight-wheeled passenger locomotives for
the New York, Lake Erie &amp; Western Railroad weigh 115,000
pounds, and have 19,500 pounds on each driving-wheel. At the
Baldwin Works, some "consolidation" engines have recently
been built which
are still heavier
than the decapod
engines.</p>

<p>The following
table gives dimensions,
weight,
price, and price
per pound of locomotives
at the
present time. If
we were to quote
them at 8 to 8¼ cents per pound for heavy engines and 9 to 22¼ for
smaller sizes, it would not be much out of the way.</p>

<p>The speed of locomotives, however, has not increased with their
weight and size. There is a natural law which stands in the way
of this. If we double the weight on the driving-wheels, the adhesion,
and consequent capacity for drawing loads, is also doubled.
Reasoning in an analogous way, it might be said that if we double
the circumference of the wheels the distance that they will travel in
one revolution, and consequently the speed of the engine, will be in
like proportion. But, if this be done, it will require twice as much
power to turn the large wheels as was needed for the small ones;
and we then encounter the natural law that the resistance increases
as the square of the speed, and probably at even a greater ratio at
very high velocities. At 60 miles an hour the resistance of a train
is four times as great as it is at 30 miles. That is, the pull on the
draw-bar of the engine must be four times as great in the one case
as it is in the other. But at 60 miles an hour this pull must be exerted
for a given distance in half the time that it is at 30 miles, so
that the amount of power exerted and steam generated in a given
period of time must be eight times as great in the one case as in the
other. This means that the capacity of the boiler, cylinders, and
the other parts must be greater, with a corresponding addition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the weight of the machine. Obviously, if the weight per wheel is
limited, we soon reach a point at which the size of the driving-wheels
and other parts cannot be enlarged; which means that there
is a certain proportion of wheels, cylinders, and boiler which will
give a maximum speed.</p>

<p>The relative speed of trains here and in Europe has been the
subject of a good deal of discussion and controversy. There appears
to be very little difference in the speed of the fastest trains
here and there; but there are more of them there than we have.
From 48 to 53 miles an hour, including stops, is about the fastest
time made by our regular trains on the summer time-tables.</p>

<p>When this rate of speed is compared with that of sixty or seventy
miles an hour, which is not infrequent for short distances, there
seems to be a great discrepancy. It must be kept in mind, though,
that these high rates of speed are attained under very favorable
conditions. That is, the track is straight and level, or perhaps descending,
and unobstructed. In ordinary traffic it is never certain
that the line is clear. A locomotive-runner must always be on the
look-out for obstructions. Trains, ordinary vehicles, a fallen tree
or rock, cows, and people may be in the way at any moment. Let
anyone imagine himself in responsible charge of a locomotive and
he will readily understand that, with the slightest suspicion that the
line is not clear, he would slacken the speed as a precautionary
measure. For this reason fast time on a railroad depends as much
on having a good signal system to assure the locomotive-runners
that the line is clear, as it does on the locomotives. If he is always
liable to encounter, and must be on the look-out for, obstructions at
frequent grade-crossings of common roads, or if he is not certain
whether the train in front of him is out of his way or not, the locomotive-runner
will be nervous and be almost sure to lose time. If
the speed is to be increased on American railroads, the first steps
should be to carry all streets and common roads either over or under
the lines, have the lines well fenced, provide abundant side-tracks
for trains, and adopt efficient systems of signals so that locomotive-runners
can know whether the line is clear or not.</p>

<p>In what may be called the period of adolescence of railroads
there was a very decided predilection on the part of locomotive engineers
for large driving-wheels. Figure 34 represents one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
engines built as early as 1848 for the Camden &amp; Amboy Railroad,
with driving wheels 8 feet in diameter. Other engines with 6 and
7 feet wheels were not uncommon. In Europe many engines with
very large wheels were made and are still in use. Here, as well
as there, excessively large wheels have, however, been abandoned,
and six feet in diameter is now about the limit of their size in this
country.</p>

<div class="figleft">

</div>

<p>So far as locomotives are concerned, fast time, especially with
heavy trains, is generally dependent more upon the supply of steam
than it is on the size of the wheels. Without steam to turn them,
big wheels are useless; but with an abundant supply there is no
difficulty in turning small wheels at a lively rate. Speed, therefore,
is to a great extent a question of boiler capacity, and the general
maxim has been formulated that "within the limits of weight and
space to which a locomotive boiler must be confined, it cannot be
made too big." But the maximum speed at which a locomotive
can run when an adequate supply of steam is provided also depends
on the perfection of the machinery. At 60 miles an hour a
driving-wheel 5½ feet in diameter revolves five times every second.
The reciprocating parts of each cylinder of a Pennsylvania Railroad
passenger engine, including one piston, piston-rod, cross-head, and
connecting rod,
weigh about 650
pounds. These
parts must move
back and forth a
distance equal to
the stroke, usually
two feet, every
time the wheel
revolves, or in a
fifth of a second.
It starts from a
state of rest at each end of the stroke of the piston and must acquire
a velocity of 32 feet per second, in one-twentieth of a second,
and must be brought to a state of rest in the same period of time.
A piston 18 inches in diameter has an area of 254½ square inches.
Steam of 150 pounds pressure per square inch would therefore
exert a force on the piston equal to 38,175 pounds. This force is
applied alternately on each side of the piston, ten times in a second.
The control of such forces requires mechanism which works with
the utmost precision and with absolute certainty, and it is for this
reason that the speed and the economical working of a locomotive
depend so much on the proportions of the valves and the "valve-gear"
by which the "distribution" of steam in the cylinders is
controlled.</p>

<p>Besides being impressive as a triumph of human ingenuity,
there is much about the construction and working of locomotives
which is picturesque. A shop where they are constructed or repaired
is always of interest. An engine-house (Fig. 35) especially
at night, is full of weird suggestions and food for the imagination.</p>

<p>Figure 37 (<a href="#Page_135">p. 135</a>) is an illustration from a photograph taken
in the erecting shops of the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia;
and Figure 38 (<a href="#Page_137">p. 137</a>) is a view of a similar shop of the
Pennsylvania Railroad at Altoona, which suggests at a glance
many of the processes of construction which go on in these great
works. At Altoona are immense travelling cranes resting on brick
arches and spanning the shop from side to side. These are power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>ful
enough to take hold of the largest locomotive and lift it bodily
from the rails and transfer it laterally or longitudinally at will. A
large consolidation engine is shown in Figure 38, swung clear of
the rails, and in the act of being moved laterally. The hooks of
the crane are attached to heavy iron beams, from which the loco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>motive
is suspended by strong bars. Figure 39 (<a href="#Page_138">p. 138</a>) is a view
in the blacksmiths' shop of the Baldwin Works, showing a steam
hammer and the operation of forging a locomotive frame.</p>

<p>It is quite natural that the engineers, or "runners," as they
generally call themselves, who have the care of locomotives should
take a deep interest in and acquire a sort of attachment for them.
In the earlier days of railroading this was much more the case than
it is now. Then each locomotive had an individuality of its own.
It was rare that two engines were exactly alike. Nearly always
there was some difference in their proportions, or one engine had
some device in it which the other had not. Now, many locomotives
are made exactly alike, or as nearly so as the most improved
machinery will permit. There is nothing to distinguish the one
from the other. Therefore Bony Smith can claim no superiority
for his machine which Windy Brown has not the advantage of. In
the old days, too, each engine had its own runner and fireman, and
it seldom fell into the hands of anyone else, and those in charge
of it took as much pride in keeping it bright as the character in
"Pinafore" did "in polishing up the handle of the big front door."
On many roads&mdash;particularly the larger ones&mdash;engines are not assigned
to special men. The system of "first in first out" has been
adopted; that is, the engines are sent out in the order in which they
come in, and the men take whichever machine happens to fall to
their lot. This naturally results in a loss of personal attachment
to special engines.</p>

<p>Every change in the construction, alteration in the proportions,
or addition to the attachments of locomotives is a subject of intense
interest to the men and a topic of endless discussion at all times
and places. The theories which are propounded, and the yarns
which are spun while sitting around hot stoves in round-houses, or
waiting for passing trains on side-tracks, would fill many books.
Jack never tires of telling what his engine did when "she was going
up Rattlesnake Grade," and Smoky Bill grows excited when
he describes how Ninety-six turned her wheels in making up
forty-nine minutes time in the down run with the "electric express."</p>

<p>Locomotive engineers and firemen read with avidity everything
which is explanatory of the construction or working of locomotives,
but generally have a contempt for things which have no practical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
bearing. They demand "lucidity" in what they read with as much
vehemence as Matthew Arnold did, and some editors and college
professors, whose writing and thinking are foggy, would be greatly
benefited by the criticisms of the Locomotive Brotherhood.</p>

<p>Much might be written about the duties of locomotive-runners
and firemen, and the qualifications required. It is the general
opinion of locomotive superintendents that it is not essential that
the men who run locomotives should be good mechanics. The
best runners or engineers are those who have been trained while
young as firemen on locomotives. Brunel, the distinguished civil
engineer, said that he never would trust himself to run a locomotive
because he was sure to think of some problem relating to his profession
which would distract his attention from the engine. It is
probably a similar reason which sometimes unfits good mechanics
for being good locomotive-runners.</p>

<p>It will perhaps interest some readers to know how much fuel
a locomotive burns. This, of course, depends upon the quality of
fuel, work done, speed, and character of the road. With freight
trains consisting of as many cars as a heavy locomotive can draw
without difficulty, the consumption of coal will not exceed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
1 to 1½ pounds of coal per car per mile if the engine is carefully
managed. It takes from 15 to 20 pounds of coal per mile to move
an engine and tender alone, the consumption being dependent upon
the size of the engine, speed, grades, and number of stops. If this
amount of coal is allowed for the engine and tender, and the balance
that is consumed is divided among the cars, it will reduce the quantity
for hauling the cars alone to even less amounts than those given
above. In ordinary average practice the consumption is from 3 to
5 pounds per freight-car per mile, without making any allowance for
the engine and tender. With passenger trains, the cars of which
are heavier and the speed higher, the coal consumption is from 10
to 15 pounds per car per mile. A freight locomotive with a train
of 40 cars will burn 40 to 200 pounds of coal per mile, the amount
depending on the care with which it is managed, quality of the
coal, grades, speed, weather, and other circumstances.</p>

<h3>AMERICAN CARS.</h3>

<p>Peter Parley's illustration (<a href="#Page_101">p. 101</a>) of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio
Railroad represents one of the earliest passenger-cars used in this
country. The accuracy of the illustration may, however, be questioned.
Probably the artist depended upon his imagination and
memory somewhat when he drew it. The engraving below (Fig.
40) is from a drawing made by the resident engineer of the
Mohawk &amp; Hudson Railroad, and from which six coaches were
made by James Goold for the Mohawk &amp; Hudson Railroad in 1831.
It is an authentic representation of the cars as made at that time.
Other old prints of railroad cars represent them as substantially
stage-coach bodies mounted on four car-wheels, as shown by Figure
41. The next step in the development of cars was that of joining
together several coach-bodies. This form was continued after
the double-truck system was adopted, as shown by Figure 42, which
represents an early Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad car, having three
sections, united. It was soon displaced by the rectangular body,
as shown in Figure 43, which is a reproduction from an old print.</p>

<p>Figure 44 is an illustration of a car used for the transportation
of flour on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, while horses were still
used as the motive power. To show how nearly all progress is a
process of evolution, it was asserted, in one of the trials of the validity
of Winans' patent on eight-wheeled cars with two trucks, that
before the date of his patent it was a practice to load firewood by
connecting two such cars with long timbers, which rested on bolsters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
attached by kingbolts to the cars. The wood was loaded on
top of these timbers, as shown in Figure 45. An old car (Fig. 46),
which antedated Winans' patent and was used at the Quincy
granite quarries for carrying
large blocks of stone, was also
introduced as evidence for the
defendants in that suit. Although
Winans was not able to
establish the validity of his patent
on eight-wheeled cars with
two trucks, he was undoubtedly one of the first to put it into practical
form, and did a great deal to introduce the system.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 43.&mdash;Early American Car, 1834.</div>
</div>

<p>The progress in the construction of cars has been fully as great
as in that of locomotives. If the old stage-coach bodies on wheels
are compared with a vestibule train of to-day the difference will be
very striking. Most of us who are no longer young can recall the
days when sleeping-cars were unknown, when a journey from an
Eastern city to Chicago meant forty-eight hours or more of sitting
erect in a car with thirty or more passengers, and an atmosphere
which was fetid. Happily those days are past, although the improvement
in the ventilation of cars has been very slow, and is
still very imperfect.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 44.&mdash;Old Car for Carrying Flour<br />

</div>

<p>Improvement has also lagged in the matter of coupling cars.
It has been shown by statistics and calculations that some hundreds
of persons are killed and some thousands injured in this country
annually in coupling cars. The use of automatic coupling, by which
cars could be connected together without going between them, it has
been supposed, would greatly lessen, if it would not entirely prevent,
this fearful sacrifice of life and limb. To accomplish this end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
though, it is essential that some one form of coupler shall be generally
adopted by all railroads. One of the obstacles in the way of
this has been the mechanical difficulty of finding a mechanism which
will satisfactorily accomplish the purpose for
which it was intended. After thirty or forty
years of invention and experiment, no automatic
coupler has been produced, which has
been approved by competent judges with a
sufficient degree of unanimity to justify its
general adoption. The patents on that class of inventions are
numbered by thousands, so that it is no light task to select the
best one or even the best kind. Besides this difficulty, there is
the other equally formidable one of inducing railroad men, of various
degrees of knowledge, ignorance, and prejudice regarding this
subject, and who are scattered all over the continent, to agree in
adopting some one form or kind of automatic coupler. Various
cliques had also been organized on different roads in the interest of
some patents, and in such cases argument and reason addressed to
them were generally wasted. Public indignation was, however,
aroused; and the stimulus of legislation in different States compelled
railroad officers to give serious attention to the subject.
After devoting some years to the investigation, the Master Car-Builders'
Association&mdash;which is composed of officers of railroad
companies, who are in charge of
the construction and repair of cars
on the different lines&mdash;has recommended
the adoption of a coupler
of the type represented by Figures
47 to 49, which has been
already applied to many cars and the indications are that it will be
very generally adopted for freight and probably for passenger cars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
If it should be, it will relieve railroad employees of the dangerous
duty of going between cars to couple them. Figure 47 shows a
plan looking down on the couplers with one of the latches, <em>A</em>,
open; Figure 48 shows it with the two couplers partly engaged;
and Figure 49 shows them when the coupling is completed.</p>

<p>One of the first problems which presented itself in the infancy
of railroads was how to keep the cars on the rails.</p>

<p>Anyone who will stand close to a line of railroad when a train
is rushing by at a speed of forty, fifty, or sixty miles an hour must
wonder how the engine and cars are kept on the track; and even
those familiar with the construction of railroad machinery often express
astonishment that the flanges of the wheels, which are merely
projecting ribs about 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches deep and 1¼ inches thick, are sufficient
to resist the impetus and swaying of a locomotive or car at
full speed. The problem of the manufacture of wheels which will
resist this wear, and will not break, has occupied a great deal of
the attention of railroad managers and manufacturers.</p>

<p>Locomotive driving-wheels in this country are always made of
cast-iron, with steel tires which are heated and put on the wheels
and then cooled. They
are thus contracted
and "shrunk" on the
wheel. The tread, that
is, the surface which
bears on the rail, and the
flange of the tire are then
turned off in a lathe,
shown in Figure 25, on <a href="#Page_121">p.
121</a>, made especially for the
purpose. For engine-truck,
tender, and car-wheels, until
within a few years, "chilled"
cast-iron wheels have
been used almost exclusively
on American railroads. If the tread and flange of a wheel were
made of ordinary cast-iron they would soon be worn out in service,
as such iron has ordinarily little capacity for resisting the wear to
which wheels are subjected. Some cast-iron, however, has the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
singular property which causes it to assume a peculiar, hard crystalline
form if, when it is melted, it is allowed to cool and solidify
in contact with a cold iron mould. The iron which is thus cooled
quickly, or "chilled," becomes very hard, and resists wear very
much better than iron which is not chilled. Car-wheels which are
made of this material are therefore cast in what is called a chill-mould.
Figure 50 represents a section of such a mould and flask in
which wheels are cast.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_143.jpg" width="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 50.&mdash;Mould and Flask in which Wheels are Cast.</div>
</div>

<p><em>A A</em> is the wheel, which is moulded in sand in the usual way.
The part <em>B B</em> of the mould, which forms the rim or tread of the
wheel, consists of a heavy cast-iron ring. The melted iron is poured
into this mould and
comes in contact
with <em>B B</em>. This
has the effect of
chilling the hot
iron, as has been
explained. In
cooling, the wheel
contracts; and for
that reason the part
between the rim <em>C</em> and the hub <em>D</em> is made of a curved form, as
shown in the section, so that if one part should cool more rapidly
than another these parts can yield sufficiently to permit contraction
without straining any portion of the wheels injuriously. For the
same reason the ribs on the back of the wheels, as shown in Figure
51, are also curved. As an additional safeguard to the unequal
contraction in cooling, the wheels are taken out of the mould while
they are red-hot, and placed in ovens where they are allowed to
remain several days so as to cool very slowly.</p>

<p>Figure 52, on <a href="#Page_145">p. 145</a>, represents a section of the tread and
flange of a chilled wheel, showing the peculiar crystalline appearance
of the chilled iron.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_144.jpg" width="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 51.&mdash;Cast-iron Car Wheels.</div>
</div>

<p>In making cast-iron wheels the quality of the iron used is of the
utmost importance. The difficulty in making good wheels lies in
the fact that most iron which is ductile and tough will not chill,
whereas hard white iron, which has the chilling property in a very
high degree, is brittle, and wheels which are made of it are liable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to break. There are some kinds of cast-iron produced in this
country which have the two qualities combined, in a very remarkable
degree; that is, they are ductile and tough, and will also chill.
Wheel-founders also mix different qualities of irons to produce
wheels with the required strength, and which will resist wear;
that is, they use a certain amount of hard white iron which will
chill, with that which is ductile and soft. By changing the proportions,
any required amount of chill can be produced. The danger
is that iron which has little strength or ductility will be fortified
with hard chilling iron, and a very weak wheel will thus be the result.
Thousands of such wheels have been bought and used because
they are cheap, and many lamentable accidents are undoubtedly
due to this cause. To guard against this, car-wheels should
always be subjected to rigid tests and inspection.</p>

<p>In Europe wheels are made of wrought-iron, with tires which
were also made of the same material before the discovery of the
improved processes of manufacturing steel, but since then they
have been made of the latter material. Owing to the breakage
of a great many cast-iron wheels of poor quality, steel-tired wheels
are now coming into very general use on American roads under
passenger-cars and engines. A great variety of such wheels is
now made. The "centres" or parts inside the tires of some of
them are cast-iron, and others are wrought-iron constructed in
various ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 52.&mdash;Section of the Tread and Flange of a Car Wheel.</div>
</div>

<p>What is known as the Allen paper wheel is used a great deal in
this country, especially under sleeping-cars. A section and front
view of one of these wheels is shown by Figure 53. It consists of a
cast-iron hub, <em>A</em>,
which is bored out
to fit the axle. An
annular disk, <em>B B</em>,
is made of layers
of paper-board
glued together
and then subjected
to an enormous
pressure.
The disk is then
bored out to fit
the hub, and its
circumference is
turned off, and the tire <em>C C</em> is fitted to it. Two wrought-iron
plates, <em>P P</em>, are then placed on either side of it, and the disk,
plates, tire, and hub are all bolted together. The paper, it will
be seen, bears the weight which rests on the hub of the axle and
the hub of the wheel.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 53.&mdash;Allen Paper Car Wheel.</div>

<p>Steel tires have the advantage that when they become worn
their treads and flanges may be turned off anew, whereas chilled
cast-iron wheels are so hard
that it is almost impossible
to cut them with any turning
tool. For this reason machines
have been constructed
for grinding the tread with a
rapidly revolving emery-wheel.
In these the cast-iron
wheel is made to turn slowly,
whereas the emery-wheel revolves
very rapidly. The
emery-wheel is then brought
close to the cast-iron wheel, so that as they revolve the projections
on the latter are cut away, and the tread is thus reduced to a true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
circular form. These machines are much used for "truing-up"
wheels which have been made flat by sliding, owing to the brakes
being set too hard.</p>

<p>Some years ago the master car-builders of the different railroads
experienced great difficulty in the transaction of their business
from the fact that there were no common names to designate
the parts of cars in different places in the country. What was
known by one name in Chicago had quite a different name in
Pittsburg or Boston. A committee was therefore appointed by
the Master Car-Builders' Association to make a dictionary of terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
used in car-construction and repairs. Such a dictionary has been
prepared, and is a book of 560 pages, and has over two thousand
illustrations. It has some peculiar features, one of which is described
as follows in the preface: "To supply the want which
demanded such a vocabulary, what might be called a double dictionary
is needed. Thus, supposing that a car-builder in Chicago
received an order for a 'journal-box'; by looking in an alphabetical
list of words he could readily find that term and a description and
definition of it. But suppose that he wanted to order such castings
from the shop in Albany, and did not know their name; it would
be impracticable for him to commence at A and look through to Z,
or until he found the proper term to designate that part." To
meet this difficulty the dictionary has very copious illustrations in
which the different parts of cars are represented and numbered, and
the names of the parts designated by the numbers are then given
in a list accompanying the engraving. An alphabetical list of
names and definitions is also given, as in an ordinary dictionary.
The definition usually contains a reference to a number and a figure
in which the object described is illustrated. In making the dictionary
the compilers selected terms from those in use, where appro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>priate
ones could be found. In other cases new names were devised.
The book is a curious illustration of a more rapid growth
of an art than of the language by which it is described.</p>

<p>The following table, compiled from "Poor's Manual of Railroads,"
gives the number of locomotives and of different kinds of
cars in this country, beginning with 1876, and for each year thereafter.
If the average length of locomotives and tenders is taken at
50 feet, those now owned by the railroads would make a continuous
train 280 miles long; and the 1,033,368 cars, if they average
35 feet in length, would form a train which would be more than
6,800 miles long.</p>

<p>The number of cars, it will be seen, has more than doubled in
ten years, so that if the same rate of increase continues for the
next decade there will be over two millions of them on the railroads
of this country alone. Beyond a certain point, numbers convey
little idea of magnitude. Our railroad system and its equipment
seem to be rapidly outgrowing the capacity of the human imagination
to realize their extent. What it will be with another half-century
of development it is impossible even to imagine.</p>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_149dc.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap">The world was born again with the building of
the first locomotive and the laying of the first
level iron roadway. The energies and activities,
the powers and possibilities then developed have
acted and reacted in every sphere of life&mdash;social,
industrial, and political&mdash;until human progress,
after smouldering like a spark for a thousand
years, has burst into a conflagration which will
soon leave small trace of the life and customs, or even the modes of
thought, which our fathers knew. But, in it all, the railroad remains
the most potent factor in every development. By bringing men
more and more closely together, and supplying them more and
more abundantly and cheaply with all the varied treasures of the
earth, stored up for millions of years for the coming of this generation,
it adds continually more fuel to the flame it originated. And
as it is necessarily reacted upon equally by every new invention or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
discovery, and by all progress in other departments of human activity,
the demands upon it, and its points of contact with everyday
life, are still increasing in geometrical progression.</p>

<p>Hence, in the practical management of railroad affairs, problems
are of constant occurrence which touch almost every pursuit
to which men give themselves, whether of finance, agriculture,
commerce, manufactures, science, or politics; and the methods,
forms, and principles under which current railroad management
is being developed (for it is by no means at a stand-still) are
the result of the necessities imposed by these multiplying problems
acting within the constraints of corporate existences.</p>

<p>For while the life of a corporation is perpetual, its powers are
constrained, and the individuals exercising them are constantly
changing. It is but an artificial individual existing for certain purposes
only, and, as it lacks some human qualities, all its methods
of doing business are influenced thereby. The business affairs
of an individual, for instance, are greatly simplified by his memory
of his transactions from day to day and from year to year.
But a corporation having no natural memory, all of its transactions
and relations must be minutely and systematically noted in its
archives. Every contract and obligation must be of record, all
property bought or constructed must go upon the books, and,
when expended or used up, must go off in due form; and especially
must an accurate system of checks guard all earnings and
expenditures, and a comprehensive system of book-keeping consolidate
innumerable transactions into the great variety of boiled-down
figures and statistics necessary for officers and stockholders
to fully understand what the property is doing.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, then, our railroads and their systems
of organization and management, like the Darwinian Topsy, have
not "been made" but have "growed."</p>

<p>Naturally, both the direction and extent of the development have
varied in different localities and under different conditions. Within
the limits of this article it would be impossible to give anything
like an exhaustive or complete account of the organization, distribution
of duties, systems of working, and of checks in the various
departments of even a single road. Most roads publish more or
less elaborate small volumes of regulations on such subjects for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
use of their various employees. The task would also be endless
to describe technically the variations of practice and of nomenclature
in different sections and on different systems. The shades of
difference, too, between managers, superintendents, or masters;
comptrollers, auditors, book-keepers, and accountants; secretaries,
cashiers, treasurers, and paymasters in different localities would
be tedious to draw. A technical account of them would be almost
a reproduction of the volumes above-mentioned. I can only
attempt to outline and illustrate very briefly the general principles
which underlie the present practice, and are more or less elaborated
as circumstances may require.</p>

<p>The principal duties connected with the management of a railroad
may be classified as follows:</p>

<p>1. The physical care of the property.</p>

<p>2. The handling of the trains.</p>

<p>3. The making rates and soliciting business.</p>

<p>4. The collection of revenue and keeping statistics.</p>

<p>5. The custody and disbursement of revenue.</p>

<p>The president is, of course, the executive head of the company,
but in important matters he acts only with the consent and approval
of the Board of Directors, or of an executive committee
clothed with authority of the board, which may be called the legislative
branch of the management. More or less of the executive
power and supervision of the president may be delegated to one or
more vice-presidents. Often all of it but that relating to financial
matters is so delegated, but, as their functions are subdivisions of
those of the president, they have no essential part in a general
scheme of authority.</p>

<p>Of the five subdivisions of duties indicated above, the first four
are usually confided to a general manager, who may also be a vice-president,
and the fifth is in charge of a treasurer, reporting directly
to the president.</p>

<p>The special departments under charge of the general manager
are each officered by trained experts:</p>

<p>A superintendent of roadway or chief engineer has charge of
the maintenance of the track, bridges, and buildings.</p>

<p>A superintendent of machinery has charge of the construction
and maintenance of all rolling stock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>A superintendent of transportation makes all schedules, and has
charge of all movements of trains.</p>

<p>A car accountant keeps record of the location, whereabout, and
movements of all cars.</p>

<p>A traffic manager has charge of passenger and freight rates, and
all advertising and soliciting for business.</p>

<p>A comptroller has charge of all the book-keeping by which the
revenue of the company is collected and accounted for. All statistics
are generally prepared in his office.</p>

<p>A paymaster receives money from the treasurer and disburses,
under the direction of the comptroller, for all expenses of operation.</p>

<p>All dividend and interest payments are made by the treasurer,
under direction of the president and board.</p>

<p>There are, besides the above, two general departments with
which all the rest have to do, to a greater or less extent&mdash;the legal
department and the purchasing department. The quantity and
variety of articles used and consumed in the operation of a railroad
are so great that it is a measure of much economy to concentrate
all purchases into the hands of a single purchasing agent, rather
than to allow each department to purchase for itself. This agent
has nothing to do but to study prices and markets. His pride is
enlisted in getting the lowest figures for his road, and the large
amount of his purchases enables him to secure the best rates. And
last, but not least, in matters where dishonesty would find so great
opportunities, it is safer to concentrate responsibility than to diffuse
it.</p>

<p>As I shall not again refer to this department, what remains of
interest for me to say about it will be said here. As an adjunct to
it, storehouses are established at central points in which stocks of
articles in ordinary use are kept on hand. Whenever supplies are
wanted in any other department&mdash;as, for instance, a bell-cord and
lantern by a conductor&mdash;requisitions are presented, approved by a
designated superior. These requisitions state whether the articles
are to be charged to legitimate wear and tear, and if so,
whether to the passenger or the freight service, and of which subdivision
of the road; or whether they are to be charged to the
conductor for other articles not properly accounted for. Without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
going into further detail, it can be readily seen how the comptroller's
office can, at the end of each month, from these requisitions,
have a complete check upon all persons responsible for the care of
property. The purchasing agent, too, from his familiarity with
prices, is usually charged with the sale of all condemned and worn-out
material.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Before returning to a more detailed review of the operating departments
of a railroad, its legal department requires a few words.
Not only is a railroad corporation, being itself a creation of the law,
peculiarly bound to conform all its actions to legal forms and tenets,
but it is also a favorite target for litigation. The popular prejudice
against corporations, it may be said in passing, is utterly illogical.
The corporation is the poor man's opportunity. Without it he
could never share in the gains and advantages open to capital in
large sums. With it a thousand men, contributing a thousand dollars
each, compete on equal terms with the millionaire. Its doors
are always open to any who may wish to share its privileges or its
prosperity, and no man is denied equal participation according to
his means and inclinations. It is the greatest "anti-poverty" invention
which has ever been produced, and the most democratic.
But, for all that, instead of possessing the unbounded power usually
ascribed to it, no creature of God or man is so helpless as a corporation
before the so-called great tribunal of justice, the American
jury. It may not be literally true that a Texas jury gave damages to
a tramp against a certain railroad because a section-master's wife
gave him a meal which disagreed with him, but the story can be
nearly paralleled from the experience of many railroads. Hence
settlements outside of the law are always preferred where they are
at all possible, and an essential part of an efficient legal organization
is a suitable man always ready to repair promptly to the scene of
any loss or accident, to examine the circumstances with the eye of
a legal expert on liabilities.</p>

<p>But the management of claims, and of loss and damage suits,
though a large part, is by no means all of the legal business connected
with a railroad. Every contract or agreement should pass
under scrutiny of counsel, and in the preparation of the various
forms of bonds, mortgages, debentures, preferred stocks, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
which the wants of the day have brought forth, the highest legal
talent finds employment. For, as development has multiplied the
types of cars
and engines to
meet special
wants, so have
a great variety
of securities
been developed
to meet the
taste and prejudices
of investors of all nations.
There is, in fact, a certain
fashion in the forms of
bonds, and the conditions incorporated
in mortgages,
which has to be observed to
adapt any bond to its proposed
market.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_154a.jpg" width="450" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We shall now return to the
operating departments under
their respective heads, and
glance briefly at the methods
and detail pursued in each.
On roads of large mileage the general manager is assisted by general
or division superintendents in charge of roadway, motive
power, and trains of one or more separate divisions; but for our
purposes we may consider the different departments without reference
to these superintendents.</p>

<div class="sandbagbox" id="img154">
 <div id="i154b1">&nbsp;</div>
 <div id="i154b2">&nbsp;</div>

<p>The superintendent of roadway or chief engineer comes first,
having charge of track, bridges, and buildings. In his office are
collected maps of all important stations and junction points, kept
up to date with changes and additions; scale drawings of all
bridges and trestles, of all standard depots, tanks, switches, rails,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
fastenings, signals, and everything necessary to secure uniformity
of patterns and practice over the entire road. Under him are
supervisors of bridges and supervisors of road, each assigned to a
certain territory. The supervisors of bridges make frequent and
minute examinations of every piece or member of every bridge and
trestle, report in advance all the repairs that become necessary,
and make requisition for the material needed.</p>

<div class="caption">A Type of Snow-plough.</div>
</div>

<p>Under the bridge supervisor are organized "bridge gangs,"
each consisting of a competent foreman with carpenters and laborers
skilled in bridge work and living in "house" or "boarding"
cars, and provided with pile-drivers, derricks, and all appliances
for handling heavy timbers and erecting, tearing down, and repairing
bridges. These cars form a movable camp, going from place
to place as needed, and being side-tracked as near as possible to
the work of the gang. Long experience begets great skill in their
special duties, and the feats which these gangs will perform are
often more wonderful than many of the more showy performances
of railroad engineering. It is an every-day thing with such gangs
to take down an old wooden structure, and erect in its place an
iron one, perhaps with the track raised several feet above the level<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of the original, while fifty trains pass every day, not one of which
will be delayed for a moment.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_156.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A Rotary Steam Snow-shovel in Operation.<br />
(From an instantaneous photograph.)</div>
</div>

<p>Each of the supervisors of road has his assigned territory divided
into "sections," from five to eight miles in
length. At a suitable place on each section are erected houses
for a resident section-master and from six to twelve hands. These
are provided with hand- and push-cars, and spend their whole
time in keeping their sections in good condition. Upon many
roads annual inspections are made and prizes offered for the best
sections. At least twice a day track-walkers from the section-gangs
pass over the entire line of road. To simplify reports and
instructions, frequently every bridge or opening in the track is
numbered, and the number displayed upon it; and every curve is
also posted with its degree of curvature and the proper elevation
to be given to the outer rail.</p>

<p>The work of the section-men is all done under regular system.
In the spring construction-trains deliver and distribute ties and
rails on each section, upon requisitions from supervisors. Then
the section-force goes over its line from end to end, putting in first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the new ties and then the new rails needed. Next the track is
gone over with minute care and re-lined, re-surfaced, and re-ballasted,
to repair the damages of frost and wet, the great enemies
of a road-bed. Then ditches, grass, and the right-of-way have attention.
These processes are continually repeated, and especially
in the fall in preparation for winter. During the winter as little
disturbance of track is made as possible, but ditches are kept
clean, and low joints are raised by "shims" on top of joint ties. Essential
parts of the equipment of any large road are snow-ploughs
(<a href="#Page_154">pp. 154&ndash;5&ndash;6</a>) and wrecking cars, with powerful derricks and
other appliances for clearing obstructions. When wrecks or blockades
occur these cars, with extra engines, section-hands, bridge
gangs, and construction-trains, are rushed to the spot, and everything
yields to the
work of getting the
road clear.</p>

<p>We come next
to the superintendent
of machinery,
whose duty it is to
provide and maintain
locomotives
and cars of all
kinds to handle the
company's traffic.
His department is
subdivided between
a master mechanic,
in charge of
locomotives and
machine-shops,
and a master car-builder,
in charge
of car-shops.</p>

<p>The master
mechanic selects and immediately controls all engine-runners and
firemen, and keeps performance sheets of all locomotives, showing
miles run, cars hauled, wages paid, coal and oil consumed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
other details giving results accomplished by different runners and
firemen, and by different types of engine, or on different divisions
or roads. Premiums are often paid the runners and firemen accomplishing
the best results.</p>

<p>The master car-builder has charge of the shops where cars are
built and repaired, and of the car-inspectors who are stationed at
central and junction points to prevent defective cars being put into
the trains.</p>

<p>Formerly each railroad used its own cars exclusively, and
through freights were transferred at every junction point. This involved
such delay and expense that railroads now generally permit
all loaded cars to go through to destination without transfer,
and allow each other a certain sum for the use of cars. Usually
this is about three-quarters of a cent for each mile which the car
travels on a foreign road. This involves a great scattering of cars,
and an extensive organization to keep record of their whereabouts
and of the accounts between the companies for mileage.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> This organization
will be referred to more fully in connection with the department
of transportation. But the joint use of each other's cars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
makes it necessary that there should be at least enough similarity
in their construction and their coupling appliances to permit their
indiscriminate use upon all roads. And conventions of master car-builders
have recommended certain forms and dimensions as standards,
which are now in general use.</p>

<p>There is much convenience in this, but one disadvantage. It
requires almost unanimous action to introduce any change of form
or of construction, however advantageous it may be. And to secure
unanimous action in such matters is almost as hard as it would
be to secure unanimity in a change in the spelling of English words.
Still there is progress, though slow, toward several desirable reforms,
the most important of which is the adoption of a standard
automatic coupler (see <a href="#Page_142">p. 142</a>).</p>

<p>Having shown how the property of all kinds is kept in efficient
condition, we next come to its operation. This is called "conducting
transportation," and the officer in charge is usually called
the superintendent of transportation. All train-despatchers, conductors,
train-men, and telegraph operators are under his immediate
control. He makes all schedules and provides all extra and
irregular service that the traffic department makes requisition for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
himself calling upon the superintendent of machinery for the necessary
locomotives, switching engines, and cars. It is his especial
province to handle all trains as swiftly as possible, and to see that
there are no collisions. It is impossible to detail fully the safeguards
and precautions used to this end, but the general principles
observed are as follows:</p>

<p>First, a general time-table or schedule is carefully made out for
all regular trains upon each division, showing on one sheet the
time of each train at each station.</p>

<p>This schedule is all that is needed so long as all trains are able
to keep on time, and there are no extras. Trouble begins when
regular trains cannot keep on schedule, or when extra trains have
to be sent out, not provided for on the schedule. A diagram,
or graphic representation of this schedule, upon a board or large
sheet of paper, is an important feature of the office regulating
train-movements. Twenty-four vertical lines divide the board into
equal spaces representing the twenty-four hours of the day, numbered
from midnight to midnight. Horizontal lines at proportionate
distances from the top represent the stations in their order between
the termini, represented by the top and bottom lines of the
diagram. The course of every train can now be plotted on this
diagram in an oblique line joining the points on each station line
corresponding to the time the train arrives at and leaves that station.
The cut on the opposite page will illustrate. It represents a
road 130 miles long from A to N, with intermediate stations B, C,
D, etc., at different distances from each other, and six trains are
shown as follows:</p>

<p>A passenger train, No. 1, leaving A at 12 midnight and arriving
at N at 4.05 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> A fast express, No. 2, leaving N at 12.45
and arriving at A at 3.30. A local passenger train, No. 4, which
leaves N at 1.15, runs to E by 4 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>, stops there until 4.10, and
returns to N by 7 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>; being called No. 3 on the return, as the
direction is always indicated by the train-number's being odd or
even. No. 5 is a way freight, leaving A at 12.05 and making long
stops at each station. No. 6 is an opposing train of the same
character.</p>

<p>The diagram shows at a glance how, when, and where all these
trains meet and pass each other, and where every train is at any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
moment. Should it be desired to
send an extra train at any time,
a line drawn or a string stretched
on the board will indicate what
opposing trains must be guarded
against. For instance, to send
an extra through in three hours,
leaving A between 1 and 2 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>,
a trial line will show that Nos. 5,
2, 4, and 6 must all be met or
passed, and as (on a single-track
road) this can only be done at
stations, the extra must leave at
1.35 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>, pass No. 5 at E, meet
No. 2 at F, No. 4 at I, and No.
6 at J. A dotted line on the diagram
indicates its run, and that
No. 2 is held at F for 5 minutes
to let it pass. If the road is
double-tracked, only trains going
in the same direction need be
regarded.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_162b.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A lamp raised and lowered vertically is<br />the signal to
move ahead.</div>
</div>

<p>But the more usual way of
handling extra trains, when circumstances
will permit, is to let
them precede or follow a regular
train upon the same schedule.
The train is then said to be run
in "sections," and a ten minutes'
interval is allowed between them.
That opposing trains may be informed,
the leading section (and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
when there are more than two
all but the last) wears on its locomotive
two green flags by day
and two green lights by night,
indicating that a train follows
which is to be considered as a
part of the train leading, and
having the same rights.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_163a.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A lamp swung vertically in a circle across the track,<br />when
the train is standing, is the signal to move back.</div>
</div>

<p>So far the rules are very simple,
and they would be all that is
necessary if all trains could always
be kept exactly on time.
But as that cannot be, provision
must be made for all the complications
which will result. The
first and most important rule is
that no train must ever, under
any circumstances, run <em>ahead</em> of
time. The next is that any train
making a stop not on its schedule
must immediately send out flagmen
with red flags, lights, and
torpedoes to protect it. This
rule is a very difficult one to enforce
without rigid discipline, and
its neglect is the cause of a large
percentage of the accidents "that
will happen." The flagman who
must go to the rear, often a half-mile,
at night, across trestles and
in storms, must frequently be left
behind, to take his chances of
getting home by being picked
up by a following train. There
is no one to watch him, and he
will often take chances, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
go as far back or as fast as he should; and if all goes well no one
is ever the wiser.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_163b.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A lamp swung vertically in a circle at arm's length<br /> across
the track, when the train is running,<br />is the signal that
the train has parted.</div>
</div>

<p>Now, when a train is prevented from arriving on time at its
meeting-point, we must have some rules by which the opposing
train may proceed, or all business on the road would be suspended
by the delay of a single train. Only the general principles of these
rules can be stated within limits. They are as follows:</p>

<p>1. All freight trains must wait indefinitely for all passenger
trains.</p>

<p>2. When one train only is behind time, the opposing train
of the same class will wait for it a specified time, usually ten
minutes, and five minutes more for possible variation of watches,
then go ahead, keeping fifteen minutes behind its schedule.</p>

<p>3. But should such a train, running on delayed time, lose
more time, or in any other way should both trains get behind time,
then the one which is bound in a certain direction&mdash;for instance,
north&mdash;has the right to the track, and the other must lie by indefinitely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span><br />

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_165.jpg" width="450" alt="" />
<div class="caption">The General Despatcher.</div>
</div>

<p>These principles, duly observed, will prevent collisions, but they
will often cause trains to lose a great deal of time. The train-despatcher,
therefore, has authority to handle extra and delayed
trains by direct telegraphic order. Every possible precaution is
taken to insure that such orders are received and correctly understood.
As there are great advantages following uniformity of
usages and rules among connecting roads, after years of conference,
in conventions and by committees, approved forms of all running
rules and signals have recently been adopted and are now in very
general use over the United States. Yet, in spite of all possible
precautions, accidents will sometimes happen. Richard Grant
White gave a name to a mental habit which, in train-despatchers,
has caused many fatal accidents. It is "heterophemy," or
thinking one thing while saying, hearing, or reading another. A
case within my knowledge, which cost a dozen lives, was as follows:
Two opposing trains were out of time, and the train-despatcher
wished to have them meet and pass at a certain station
we will call "I," as Nos. 1 and 2 are represented as doing on the
diagram (see diagram of schedule board, <a href="#Page_161">p. 161</a>). So he telegraphed
the following message, to be delivered to No. 1 at "H"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and to No. 2 at "J": "Nos. 1 and 2 will meet at 'I.'" This message
was correctly received at "J" and delivered to No. 2. But at
"H" the operator had just sold a passenger a ticket to "K," and,
getting this name in his head, he wrote out the message: "Nos. 1
and 2 will meet at 'K.'" But the mistake was not yet past correction.
The operator had to repeat the message back to the despatcher,
that the latter might be sure it was correctly understood.
He repeated it as he had written it&mdash;"K." But the despatcher
was also "heterophemous." He <em>saw</em> "K," but he <em>thought</em> "I,"
and replied to the operator that the message was O. K.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_167.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Entrance Gates at a Large Station.</div>
</div>

<p>So it was delivered to No. 1, and that train left "H" at full
speed, expecting to run thirty-five miles to "K" before meeting
No. 2. There was no telegraph office at "I," and there were no
passengers to get off or on, and it passed there without stopping,
and three miles below ran into No. 2 on a curve.</p>

<p>By one of those strange impulses which seem to come from
some unconscious cerebration, the train-despatcher meanwhile had
a feeling that something was wrong, and looked again at the message
received from "H" and discovered his mistake. But the
trains were then out of reach. He still hoped that No. 2 might arrive
at "I" first, or that they might meet upon a straight portion
of road, and as the time passed he waited at the instrument in a
state of suspense which may be imagined. When the news came
he left the office, and never returned.</p>

<p>Double tracks make accidents of this character impossible; but
introduce a new possibility, that a derailment from any cause upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
one track may obstruct the
other track so closely ahead
of an opposing train that
no warning can be given.</p>

<p>Where trains become
very numerous additional
safeguards are added by multiplying telegraph stations at short intervals,
and giving them conspicuous signals of semaphore arms and
lanterns, until finally the road is divided into a number of so-called
"blocks" of a few miles each; and no train is permitted to enter
any block until the train preceding has passed out. And in the
approaches to some of our great depots, where trains and tracks are
multiplied and confused with cross-overs and switching service, all
switches are set and all movements controlled by signals from a single

apparatus, it is made mechanically impossible to open a track for the

another train might interfere. The illustrations on pages 169, 171,

<p>There remains one other branch of the duties of the master of
transportation&mdash;the proper daily distribution of cars to every station
according to its needs, and the keeping record of their whereabouts.
And now that the gauges of all roads are similar, and
competition enforces through shipments, roads are practically making
common property of each other's cars, and the detail and
trouble of keeping record of them become enormous.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><p>Interior of a Switch-tower, showing the Operation of Interlocking Switches.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The records are made up from daily reports, by every conductor,
of every car, home or foreign, handled in his train, and from
every station-agent of all cars in his yard at certain hours. From
these returns the car accountant reports to their respective owners
all movements of foreign cars and gives the transportation department
information where cars are lying. The honesty of each
other's reports concerning car movements is generally relied upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
by railroads, but "lost car agents" are kept travelling to hunt up
estrays, and to watch how the cars of their roads are being handled.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that a great step in advance would be to
have all the roads in the United States unite and put all cars
into a common stock and let them be distributed, record kept of
movements, and mileage paid through a general clearing house.
This would practically form a single rolling-stock company owned
by the roads contributing their cars to it. It could gradually introduce
uniform patterns of construction, improved couplers, and
air-brakes, and could concentrate cars in different sections of the
country in large numbers as different crops required movement,
thus avoiding the blockades which often occur in one section while
cars are superabundant in another. Consolidations usually render
more efficient and cheaper service than separate organizations can
do, and this may come about in the course of time.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>We have now seen how the road is maintained and its trains
safely handled. The next step in order is to see how business is
secured and the rates to be charged are fixed. This department
may be controlled by a traffic manager, with two assistants&mdash;the
general freight agent and the general passenger agent&mdash;or the officers
may report directly to the general manager without the intervention
of a traffic manager. But it would be a more accurate expression
to say, not that these officers "fix" the rates, for if they
did few railroads would ever fail, but that they accept and announce
the rates that are fixed by conditions of competition between different
markets and products, and between different railroads and water
lines. Among these complex forces a railroad freight agent is
nearly as powerless to regulate rates as a professor of grammar is
to regulate the irregularities of English verbs. He can accept them
and use them, or he may let them alone, but the irregularities will
remain, all the same. There is no eccentricity, for example, more
idiotic or indefensible to the ordinary citizen than a habit railroads
have of sometimes charging less money for a long haul than they
charge for a shorter haul. Yet I believe there is not a railroad
line in the United States which will not be found guilty of this apparent
folly of charging "less for the long haul" if its rates to distant
points are followed far enough. For if followed far enough we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
shall come to the ocean, and find the railroad accepting business
between two seaports. For instance, all railroads running westward
from New York through some of their connections finally
reach San Francisco, and compete for freight between these ports.
But the rates they are able to obtain are limited by steamers using
the ocean for a highway, and sailing vessels using the wind for
motive power, and able to carry heavy freights at one-tenth the
average cost to railroads across mountains and deserts. This
average cost must fix the average rates charged by the railroads
to intermediate points, such as to Ogden, in Utah. So the railroad
must either charge less for the long haul to San Francisco, or leave
that business to be done solely by water. Yet it may be profitable
to the railroad to accept the business at such rates as it can obtain;
for, as in all business ventures, manufacturing or mercantile, <em>new</em>
business can be profitably added at less than the average cost.
And if profitable to the railroad its tendency is beneficial, even to
the intermediate points which pay higher rates, as promoting better
service, besides being advantageous to the whole Pacific Coast in
tending to keep down the rates by water.</p>

<p>But it would lead too far from our subject to follow this and
several other questions which are suggested by it. Only it may
be said briefly that the original Interstate Commerce Bill, introduced
by Mr. Reagan, absolutely prohibited "less for the long
haul." The Senate amended by adding "under similar circumstances
and conditions," and the Interstate Commerce Commission
has held that "water competition" makes dissimilar circumstances
and thus legalizes it.</p>

<p>And in this connection it may be added that the other Senate
amendment to the Reagan bill, creating an Interstate Commerce
Commission, was, next to the above amendment, the wisest measure
of the bill. It forms a body of experts whose opinions and
decisions must gradually educate the public, on the one hand, to a
better understanding of transportation problems, and restrain the
railroads, on the other, from many of the abuses incident to unchecked
competition among them. For, however theorists may
differ as to the advantages or disadvantages of competition in manufactures
and commerce, either absolutely unchecked or checked
only by high or low tariffs, I think all will agree that unchecked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
<em>railroad</em> competition is a great evil, because it results in fluctuating
rates and private rebates to large shippers. The rebates, to be
sure, are forbidden by law, but they can be disguised past recognition.
I have known a case, for instance, where a receipt was
given for 75 barrels of whiskey, when only 73 were shipped. The
shipper was to make claim for two barrels lost and be paid an agreed
value as a rebate on his freight bill. In another case, a road
agreed with a certain shipper to pay his telegraph bills for a certain
period in order to control his shipments. Understating the weight
or class of the shipment is another common device for undercharging
or rebating.</p>

<p>In nearly every foreign country there is either a railroad pool
or a division of territory, to prevent this sort of competition, which
is only pernicious. A merchant needs to feel assured that rates
are stable and uniform to all, and not that he must go shopping for
secret rates, in order to be on an equality with his competitor.
In the United States the railroads had largely resorted to pools
before the Interstate Commerce Law forbade them. The result
of this prohibition has generally been very advantageous to the
best lines, which, under the pool, really paid a sort of blackmail to
the poorer lines to maintain rates. If the penalties of the law can
restrain such lines from rebating and under-billing, to be rid of the
pool will be a great blessing to the well-located roads. If not,
then the roads will be driven into consolidation, for the end of
fighting will be bankruptcy and sale. Fortunately consolidation
has already gone so far in many sections of the country that the
difficulties of abolishing rebates have been greatly reduced. And
as far as it has gone it has proved of much advantage both to the
public and to the stockholders.</p>

<p>Fortunately, too, the other results attendant upon consolidation
have been sufficiently demonstrated to remove any intelligent fear
of extortion in rates or deterioration of service. Who would to-day
desire to undo the consolidations which have built up the
Pennsylvania Railroad or the New York Central, and call back to
life the numberless small companies which preceded them? The
country has outgrown such service as they could render, and the
local growth and development along the lines of these consolidated
companies certainly indicates improved conditions. In this con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>nection,
too, the improvement in cost and character of service is
instructive. In 1865 the average rate per ton per mile on the principal
Eastern lines was about 2.900 cents; in 1887 it was 0.718
for a service twice as speedy and efficient.</p>

<p>There are many other live issues of great interest and importance
in transportation suggested by this subject, such as "re-billing"
or "milling in transit," and "differentials," but space forbids
more than an explanation of the meaning of these two especially
prominent ones.</p>

<div class="center">
<br />
A<span class="pad10">B</span><span class="pad10">C</span><br />
<hr class="chapa" />
<br />
</div>

<p>Let A B and B C be two railroads connecting at B. Let the
local rates A to B be 10 cents per 100 lbs. on grain, and B to C
also 10 cents. Let the through rate A to C be 18, since longest
hauls are usually cheapest per mile. Let A be a large grain market,
such as Chicago. Now a merchant at C can save 2 cents per
100 lbs. by buying direct from A instead of buying from a merchant
at B. For the grain will pay less for the single long haul
than for the two short hauls. But perhaps the town of B has for
many years enjoyed the trade of C, and there are large mills and
warehouses erected there. B will then say it is "discriminated
against," and will demand the privilege of "re-billing" or "milling
in transit." That is to say, when a merchant or miller at B
ships to C grain, or flour made of grain, which he received from A,
the two roads consent to make a new way-bill and treat the shipment
as a through shipment from A to C. The road B C charges
but 8 cents, and the road A B gives B C one cent from the 10 it
originally collected. This involves much trouble and a loss of revenue
to the roads, and is, apparently, a discrimination against the
home products of B, but roads frequently do it where there is competition
at C by rival lines, and also at local points along their lines
to build up mills, distilleries, and factories of all kinds in competition
with those located elsewhere. As yet the Interstate Commerce
Commission has not pronounced upon this practice.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_176.jpg" width="275" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The question of differentials is as follows: Suppose there are
three lines, B, D, and E, between the cities A and C (Diagram,
<a href="#Page_176">page 176</a>). B, being the shortest, will get most of the business when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
rates are the same (10 cents, for instance) by each line. But D
and E insist upon participating, so they demand that B shall allow
them to operate lower or "differential"
rates&mdash;that is, B must
maintain his rate at 10 while allowing
D to charge only 8 and
E 6 cents, on account of their
disadvantages. So that a differential is practically a premium
offered for business by an inferior line.</p>

<p>The foregoing will illustrate how the rivalry of railroads with
each other complicates the making of rates. But even more difficult
to manage is the rivalry of markets, and of products, and of
new methods which threaten property invested in old methods; as,
for instance, the dressed-beef traffic from the West threatens the
investments in slaughter-houses and stock-yards in the East.</p>

<p>As the roads have found it necessary to act together in establishing
running rules and regulations, so, in spite of all rivalries,
there must also be joint agreements reached in some way concerning
rates. Usually the roads serving a certain territory form an
"association," and their freight agents form "rate committees,"
which fix and publish joint rates. A tariff published by one of the
trunk lines from the Eastern cities forms a good example. As the
result of many long and bitter wars and many compromises, it has
been agreed among these roads that the rates from New York to
Chicago shall form a basis for all other rates, and a scale has been
fixed showing the percentage of the Chicago rate to be used as
the rate to each important point in the West. Thus Pittsburgh,
Pa., is 60 per cent. of Chicago rate; Indianapolis is 93; Vandalia,
116. The tariff above referred to gives an alphabetical list of some
5,000 towns reached over these roads, and opposite each town the
figure showing its percentage of the Chicago rate. The list begins
with Abanaka, O., 90, and ends with Zoar, O., 74.</p>

<p>The tariff next gives what is called the "Trunk Line Classification,"
which is a list comprising every article known to commerce,
in all the different conditions, shapes, and packages in which it is
offered for transportation, and opposite each article is given its assigned
"class." This particular classification assigns every article
to one of six regular, or two special, classes, and the present rates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
to Chicago in cents per 100 lbs. are given as 75, 65, 50, 35, 30, 25,
26, 21. The list of articles begins with Acetate of Lime, in car-loads,
5th class; in less quantities, 4th; and ends with Zinc, in various
forms from 1st to 6th&mdash;comprising in all nearly 6,000 articles.
From these tables any desired rate readily appears. Thus, 500
pounds of acetate of lime would cost, from New York to Zoar, O.,
74 per cent. of Chicago's 4th class rate, or 74 per cent. of 35&mdash;say,
26 cents per 100 lbs., or $1.30.</p>

<p>There is also given in the tariff pamphlet a list of some 300
manufacturing towns in New England, from each of which the same
rates apply as from New York. So, on the whole, the pamphlet
gives rates on about 6,000 articles from 300 points of origin to
5,000 destinations.</p>

<p>In different sections of the country different classifications are
in use, some of them embracing twenty or more classes, and allowing
finer shades of difference between articles according to their
value, bulk, or many other varying conditions which determine the
class into which each article is put.</p>

<p>Great efforts have been made to bring about a uniformity of
classification over the whole United States, and the number of classifications
in extensive use has been reduced from a very large number
to perhaps a dozen.</p>

<p>But absolute uniformity cannot be obtained under the widely
different conditions which prevail in different sections, without great
loss and sacrifices somewhere. A road, for instance, competing with
a river or canal must adjust the classification of the particular kinds
of freight best adapted to river or canal transportation so as to
secure the traffic in competition with boats. It must almost entirely
disregard bulk, value, and all other conditions upon which a
road not affected by this particular kind of competition arranges its
classification. Uniformity would either force one of them to lose
a legitimate business, or the other to reduce reasonable rates.</p>

<p>These rates and classifications are the battle-ground for all the
innumerable rivalries of trade and commerce. Every city is here
at war with every other city, every railroad with every other road,
every industry with those which rival it, and every individual shipper
is a skirmisher for a little special rate, or advantage, all to himself.
State legislatures and commissions, Congress, and the Inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>state
Commerce Commission are the heavy artillery which different
combatants manage to bring into the contest. On these rates
probably a million dollars are collected every day, yet it is very
rarely that the <em>positive</em> rates are fought over or complained of.
Their average is considerably below that of the average rates of
any other country in the world, even though other nations have
cheaper labor and denser populations. Fifty cents for carrying a
barrel of flour a thousand miles cannot be called exorbitant, and, indeed,
the retail prices paid for bread and clothing would probably
not be reduced in the slightest were the transportation of all such
articles absolutely free. But the battle is over the <em>comparative</em>
rates to different points, over different routes, and for different commodities.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Passenger rates are established in much the same manner as
freight rates. There are passenger-agents' associations and conventions,
and they fight as do the freight men over comparative
rates and differentials, and commissions to agents. The last within
a few years has been a fearful abuse, and is not yet entirely
abolished. This will illustrate:</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_179.jpg" width="275" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The road A B has two connections, C and D, to reach E. It
sells tickets over each at the same rate, and stands neutral between
them. But C agrees with A's ticket-seller that he will give him a
dollar for every ticket he can sell over C's line. D finds that he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
losing travel, and offers, privately, a larger commission. Neither
knows what the other is doing. The ticket-seller gets his regular
salary from A, and from C and
D often enormous sums as commissions,
and is interested, not
in sending ignorant travellers over the line which might suit them
best, but over the one paying him the largest secret commission.
This should be held as against public policy, because it tends to
prevent reductions in rates to the public by robbing the roads of
much of their revenue, and it also demoralizes the officers who
handle a business which is practically but the giving away of large
sums of money as bribes.</p>

<p>There is another practice in the passenger business which is
unfair at the best and is the source of many abuses. It is charging
the same to the man with no baggage as to the man with a Saratoga
trunk. If the baggage service were specially organized as a
trunk express, it could be more efficiently handled and without any
"baggage smashing," while the total cost of travelling to persons
with baggage would be no more than at present, and to those
without, much less.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the sort of abuses to which it is now liable,
I may cite a single case. I have known a merchant buy a lot of
twenty trunks for his trade, pack them all full of dry-goods, check
them to a city 1,000 miles away by giving a few dollars to baggage-men,
and himself buy a single ticket and go by a different route.
The roads which handled that baggage imagined that it belonged
to their passengers, and were never the wiser. While the baggage
service is free, no efficient checks can be provided against such frauds.</p>

<p>Essential parts of both freight and passenger departments are
the soliciting agents. They are like the cavalry pickets and scouts
of an army, scattered far and wide over the country and looking
after the interests of their lines, making personal acquaintances of
all shippers and travellers, advertising in every possible manner,
and reporting constantly all that the enemy&mdash;the rival lines&mdash;are
doing, and often a great deal that they are not. For the great
railroad wars usually begin in local skirmishes brought on by the
zeal of these pickets when the officers in command would greatly
prefer to live in peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides their receipts from freight and passenger traffic, railroads
derive revenue also from the transportation of mails and express
freight on passenger trains, from the sleeping-car companies,
and from news companies for the privilege of selling upon trains.
Of the total revenue about 70 per cent. is usually derived from
freight, 25 per cent. from passengers, and 5 per cent. from mail, express,
sleeping-cars, and privileges. When it is considered that
high speed involves great risks and necessitates a far more perfect
roadway, more costly machinery and appliances, and a higher grade
and a greater number of employees, the fast passenger, mail, and
express traffic hardly seems at present to yield its due proportion
of income.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have now followed the line of organization and management
through the physical maintenance of the road and rolling
stock, the safe handling of the trains, the establishment of rates,
and solicitation of business. It only remains to show how the revenue
is collected, how the expenses of operation are paid, and all
statistics of the business prepared. These duties are usually united
under charge of an officer called the comptroller, general auditor,
or some equivalent title. His principal subordinates, whose duties
are indicated by their titles, are the auditor of receipts, auditor of
disbursements, local treasurer, paymaster, and clerk of statistics.</p>

<p>The record of a single shipment of freight will illustrate methods,
so far as limits will permit. A shipper sending freight for shipment
sends with each dray-load a "dray ticket" in duplicate, showing
the articles, weight, marks, and destination. If he has prepaid
the freight, or advanced any charges which are to be paid at destination,
it is also noted on the dray ticket. When the drayman
reaches the outbound freight depot with his load, he is directed to
a certain spot where all freight for the same destination is being
collected for loading. A receiving clerk checks off his load against
the duplicate dray tickets, keeps one and files it, and gives the
drayman the other, receipted. In case of any loss arising afterward,
the original dray ticket, made by the shipper himself, with
his marks and instructions, becomes a valuable record. When the
entire shipment has been delivered at the loading point, the shipper
takes the dray tickets representing it to the proper desk, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
receives "a bill of lading." This bill of lading is made in triplicate.
The original and a duplicate are given to the shipper. He keeps
the last and sends the former to the consignee. It represents the
obligation of the railroad to transport and deliver the articles named
on it to the person named, or his assignee. It is negotiable, and
banks advance money upon it. But the shipper may still, by a
legal process, have the goods stopped <em>en route</em> should occasion
arise, as, for instance, by the bankruptcy of the consignee. The
goods are also liable for garnishments in certain cases, and there
is much railroad and commercial law which it behooves the officials
interested to be well posted in. When the goods arrive at destination
the possession of the bill of lading is the evidence of the
consignee's right to receive them.</p>

<p>Now we will return to the shipment itself and see how it is
taken care of. The whole structure of the system of collecting
freight revenue, holding accountable all agents who assess it and
collect it, dividing it in the agreed proportions between all the railroads,
boats, bridges, wharves, and transfer companies who may
handle it in its journeys, even across the continent, and the tabulating
of the immense mass of statistics which are kept to show, separately,
the quantities of freight of every possible class and variety,
by every possible route, and to and from every possible point of
destination and departure&mdash;all this system, neither the magnitude
nor the minute elaboration of which can be adequately described
within limits, is founded upon a paper called the way-bill.</p>

<p>The theory of the way-bill is that no car must move without
one accompanying it, describing it by its number and the initials of
the road owning it, and showing its points of departure and destination,
its entire contents, with marks and weights of each package,
consignors and consignees, freight and charges prepaid or to
be collected at destination, and the proportion of the same due to
each carrier or transfer in the line. And not only must a way-bill
accompany the car, but a duplicate of it must be sent immediately
and directly, by the office making the original, to the office of the
auditor of freight receipts. If the railroad is a member of any association,
as the Trunk Line Association in New York, another duplicate
is sent to its office, that it may supervise all rates, and see
what each road is doing. The sum of all the way-bills is the total<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of a road's freight business. To facilitate taking copies they are
printed with an ink which will give several impressions on strong,
thin tissue-paper, forming "soft copies," while the "hard copy," or
original, goes with the freight to be checked against it when the
car is unloaded.</p>

<p>And while the original way-bill fulfils its important function of
conducting the freight to destination and delivery, the duplicate
which was forwarded directly to the auditor of freight receipts has
no less important purposes. It is the initial record that freight
has been earned, and it shows which agent of the company has
been charged with its collection. Before making any entries from
it its absolute correctness must be assured. For this purpose all
its figures are first checked by a rate-clerk, who is kept constantly
supplied by the traffic department with all current rates, classifications,
and percentage tables by which through freights are divided.
These way-bills, coming in daily by hundreds and thousands, are
then the grist upon which the office of the auditor of receipts
grinds, and from which come forth the accounts with every agent,
showing his debits for freight received, and the consolidations
showing the freight earnings of the road. Agents remit the moneys
they collect direct to the treasurer, who makes daily reports
of the credits due to each one. A travelling auditor visits every
station at irregular intervals and checks the agent's accounts, requiring
him to justify any difference between his debits and credits
by an exhibit of undelivered freight.</p>

<p>The passenger earnings are obtained from daily reports by all
conductors of their collections, and by all ticket-sellers of tickets
sold. These reports are also checked by a passenger rate-clerk,
and the travelling auditor frequently examines and verifies the
tickets reported by agents as on hand unsold.</p>

<p>After the auditor of receipts has finished with the way-bills and
ticket reports, they go to the statistical department, where are
prepared the great mass and variety of statistics required by different
officers to keep themselves thoroughly posted on the growth
or decrease of business of every variety, and from and to every
market reached by the road. Finally, the way-bills are filed away
for reference in case of claims for overcharges, or lost or damaged
goods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>The auditor of disbursements has supervision of all expenditures
of money, which is only paid out by the paymaster or treasurer
upon vouchers and pay-rolls approved by proper authority.
The vouchers and pay-rolls then form the grist upon which his
office works, and from which are produced the credits to be given
all officers and agents who disburse money, and the classified
records of expenses, and comparison of the same with previous
months and years, and between different divisions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have thus outlined the skeleton of a railroad organization,
and suggested briefly the relations between its most important
parts, and some of the principles upon which its work is conducted.
The scheme of authority is outlined in the diagram on
<a href="#Page_185">page 185</a>. But space is utterly lacking to clothe the skeleton with
flesh and go into the innumerable details and adjustments involved
in the economical and efficient discharge of all of its
functions.</p>

<p>It seems a very simple matter for a railroad to place a barrel of
flour in a car, to carry it to its destination, and to collect fifty cents
for the service. It is done apparently so spontaneously that even
the fifty cents may seem exorbitant, and I have actually heard appeals
for free transportation on the ground that the cars were
going anyhow. So it also seems a very simple matter for a man
to pick up a stone and place it on a wall. But this simple act involves
in the first place the existence of a bony frame, with joints,
sinews, and muscles, sustained by a heart, lungs, and digestive
system, with eyes to see, a brain to direct, nerves to give effect to
the will-power, and a thousand delicate adjustments of organs and
functions without which all physical exertion would soon cease.
Similarly, a railroad organized to respond efficiently to all the
varied demands upon it as a common carrier, by the public, and
as an investment by its owners, becomes almost a living organism.
That the barrel of flour may be safely delivered and the fifty cents
reach the company's treasury, and a part of it the stockholder's
pocket, the whole organization outlined in the diagram must thrill
with life, and every officer and employee, from president to car-greaser,
must discharge his special functions. All must be coordinated,
and the organization must have and use its eyes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
its ears, its muscle, its nerves, and its brain. It must immediately
feel and respond to every demand of our rapidly advancing
civilization.</p>

<p>Each road usually has its own individuality and methods, and
its employees are animated with an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>, as are the soldiers
in an army. There is much about the service that is attractive,
and, on the whole, the wages paid railroad employees are
probably in excess of the rates for similar talent in any other industry,
although labor in every other industry in the United
States is protected by high tariffs, while in this it is under the
incubus of legislation as oppressive as constitutional limits will
permit.</p>

<p>In Europe, where the pooling system practically prevails, the
service is much more stable than in the United States, and in
many instances there are pensions and insurances and disability
funds, and regular rules for promotion and retirement, and provision
for the children of employees being brought into service in
preference to outsiders. Such relations between a company and
its employees as must result from arrangements of this character
are surely of great benefit to both. They are the natural outgrowth
of <em>stability of business</em>. Their most advanced form is
found in France, where each road is practically protected from
dangerous competition by means of a division of territory. In the
United States we are still in the midst of a fierce competition for
territory and business, and, as pooling is forbidden, the railroad
companies will be in unstable equilibrium until consolidation takes
place. As that goes on, and large and rich corporations are
formed, with prospects of stability in management and in business,
we may hope to see similar relations established between our companies
and their employees. Already there is a beginning upon
some of the largest roads, such as the Baltimore &amp; Ohio and the
Pennsylvania Central. But the ground still needs preparation also
on the employees' side, for our American spirit is aggressive and
is sometimes rather disposed to resent, as interfering with its independence,
any paternal relations with a corporation. And as we
have before found railroad management in intimate contact with
every problem of finance and commerce, it is here confronted with
the social and industrial questions involved in labor unions and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
problems of co-operation. As to the results, we can only say that,
as war is destructive, no state of warfare, even between capital and
labor, can be permanent. Peaceful solutions must prevail in the
end, and progress toward stability, peace, and prosperity in railroad
operation and ownership will be progress toward the happy
solution of many vexed social questions.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">In 1829, when Ericsson's little locomotive "Novelty,"
weighing two and a half tons, ran a short
distance at the rate of thirty miles an hour, a
writer of the time said that "it was the most
wonderful exhibition of human daring and human
skill that the world had ever seen." To-day
trains weighing four hundred tons thunder by at
seventy-five miles an hour, and we hardly note
their passage. We take their safety as a matter of course, and seldom
think of the tremendous possibilities of destruction stored up
in them. But seventy-five miles an hour is one hundred and ten feet
a second, and the energy of four hundred tons moving at that rate
is nearly twice as great as that of a 2,000-pound shot fired from a
100-ton Armstrong gun. This is the extreme of weight and speed
now reached in passenger service, and, indeed, is very rarely attained,
and then but for short distances; but sixty miles is a common
speed, and a rate of forty or fifty miles is attained daily on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
almost every railroad in the country. We cannot tell from the
time-tables how fast we travel. The schedule times do not indicate
the delays that must be made up by spurts between stations.
The traveller who is curious to know just how fast he is going,
and likes the stimulus of thinking that he is in a little danger, may
find amusement in taking the time between mile-posts; and when
these are not to be seen, he can often get the speed very accurately
by counting the rails passed in a given time. This may be
done by listening attentively at an open window or door. The
regular clicks of the wheels over the rail-joints can usually soon be
singled out from the other noises, and counted. The number of
rail-lengths passed in twenty seconds is almost exactly the number
of miles run in an hour.</p>

<div class="caption">Danger Ahead!</div>
</div>

<p>But if one wants to get a lively sense of what it means to rush
through space at fifty or sixty miles an hour, he must get on a
locomotive. Then only does he begin to realize what trifles stand
between him and destruction. A few months ago a lady sat an
hour in the cab of a locomotive hauling a fast express train over a
mountain road. She saw the narrow bright line of the rails and
the slender points of the switches. She heard the thunder of the
bridges, and saw the track shut in by rocky bluffs, and new perils
suddenly revealed as the engine swept around sharp curves. The
experience was to her magnificent, but the sense of danger was
almost appalling. To have made her experience complete, she
should have taken one engine ride in a dark and rainy night. In
a daylight ride on a locomotive, we come to realize how slender is
the rail and how fragile its fastenings, compared with the ponderous
machine which they carry. We see what a trifling movement
of a switch makes the difference between life and death. We learn
how short the look ahead must often be, and how close danger
sits on either hand. But it is only in a night ride that we learn
how dependent the engineer must be, after all, upon the faithful
vigilance of others. We lean out of the cab and strain our eyes
in vain to see ahead. The head-light reveals a few yards of glistening
rail, and the ghostly telegraph poles and switch targets.
Were a switch open, a rail taken up, or a pile of ties on the track,
we could not possibly see the danger in time to stop. The
friendly twinkle of a signal lamp, shining faintly, red or white, tells
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the engineer that the way is blocked or is clear, and he can only
rush along trusting that no one of a dozen men on whom his life
depends has made a mistake.</p>

<p>When one reflects upon the destructive energy which is contained
in a swiftly moving train, and sees its effects in a wreck;
when he understands how many minute mechanical details, and
how many minds and hands must work together in harmony to insure
its safe arrival at its destination, he must marvel at the safety
of railroad travel. In the year 1887, the passengers killed in train
accidents in the United States were 207; those injured were 916.
The employees killed were 406, and injured 890.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> These were in
train accidents only, it must be remembered, and do not include
persons killed at crossings, or while trespassing on the track, or
employees killed and injured making up trains. As will be seen
later, the casualties in these two classes are much greater than
those from train accidents. The total passenger movement in
1887 was equal to one passenger travelling 10,570,306,710 miles.
That is to say, a passenger might have travelled 51,000,000 miles
before being killed, or 12,000,000 miles before being injured. Or
he might travel day and night steadily at the rate of 30 miles an
hour for 194 years before being killed. Mark Twain would doubtless
conclude from this that travelling by rail is much the safest
profession that a man could adopt. It is unquestionably true that
it is safer than travelling by coach or on horseback, and probably
it is safer than any other method of getting over the earth's surface
that man has yet contrived, unless it may be by ocean steamer.
If one wants anything safer he must walk.</p>

<p>In considering the means that have been adopted to make railroad
travel safe, it must be remembered that there are very few
devices in use that are purely safety appliances. Nearly everything
used on a railroad has an economic or mechanical value, and
if it promotes safety that is but part of its duty. The great source
of safety in railroad working is good discipline. Of all the train
accidents which have happened in the United States in the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
sixteen years, nearly ten per cent. were due to negligence in operation,
and seventeen per cent. were unexplained. Of these no
doubt many were due to negligence, and many that were attributed
to defects of track and equipment
would have been prevented, had
men done their duty. The value
of mechanical appliances for safety
is perhaps as often overrated
as underrated. Undoubtedly the
best, and in the long run the
cheapest, practice will be that
which combines in the highest
degree both elements&mdash;disciplined
intelligence and perfection of mechanical details.</p>

<div class="caption">Driver-brake on Modern Locomotive.</div>
</div>

<p>First in importance among the mechanisms which demand attention
here is the brake. From the beginning of railroads the
necessity for brakes was apparent, and in 1833 Robert Stephenson
patented a steam driver-brake (the brake on the driving-wheels).
This was but four years after the Rainhill trials, which settled the
question of the use of locomotives on the Liverpool &amp; Manchester
Railroad. This
early brake contained
the principle
of the driver-brake,
operated
by steam or air,
which has in late
years come into
wide use. The
apparatus is so
simple that the
cut representing
it hardly needs
explanation. Admission
of steam
into the cylinder
raised the piston, which through a lever and rod raised the toggle-joint
between the brake-blocks and forced them against the treads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of the wheels. Essentially the same method of applying the retarding
force can now be seen on most passenger engines, and
often, but not so commonly, on engines for freight service. For
various reasons Stephenson's
driver-brake did not come into
use.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_193a.jpg" width="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption">English Screw-brake, on the Birmingham and Gloucester
Road, about 1840.</div>
</div>

<p>Innumerable devices for car-brakes
have been invented, but
they divide themselves into two
groups: those in which the retarding
force is applied to the circumference of the wheel, and
those in which it is applied to the rail. The class of brakes in
which the retarding force is applied to the rail has been little used,
although various contrivances have been devised to transfer a portion
of the weight of the car from the wheels to runners sliding on
the rails. There are many objections to the principle, and it will
probably never again be seriously considered by railroad men.
The apparatus is necessarily heavy, the power required to apply
it is great, and its action is slow. When brought into action it is
not as efficient as the brake applied to the tread of the wheels, and
the transfer of the load increases the chance of derailment.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_193b.jpg" width="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption">English Foot-brake on the Truck of a Great Western
Coach, about 1840.</div>
</div>

<p>Many different devices have been used to apply the brake-shoes
to the wheels, and various sources of power. Hand-power
brakes have been used, worked by
levers, or by screws, or by winding
a chain on a staff; or, in still other
forms, springs wound up by hand
are released and apply the brakes
by their pressure. The momentum
of the train has been employed to wind up chains by the rotation
of the axles. This is the principle of the chain-brake, very
much used in England. This same source of power has been utilized
by causing the drawheads, when thrust in as the cars run together,
to wind up the brake-chains. Hydraulic pressure has been
used in cylinders under the cars; and finally air, either under pressure
or acting against a vacuum, has been found to be the most
useful of all means of operating train-brakes. Early forms of hand-brakes
are seen in the illustrations of some old English cars. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
coach shows a hand-brake operated by a screw and system of
levers. By turning a crank the guard puts in operation the system
of levers which apply the brake with great force; but the operation
is slow. The common hand-brake of the United States is too
well known to need illustration. With this brake a chain is wound
around the foot of a staff, and the pull of this chain is transmitted
by a rod to the brake-levers. This apparatus is simple, and when
a train is manned by a sufficient number of smart brakemen it is
capable of doing good service. This simple form of hand-brake
will probably be used in freight-car service until it is replaced by
air-brakes, and the various forms of chain and momentum brakes
do not appear likely to be much more used in the future than they
have been in the past. Therefore, no further space will be given
to them.</p>

<p>The expression, electric brake, is now often heard, and requires
a word of explanation. There are various forms of so-called electric
brakes which are practicable, and even efficient, working devices.
In none of them, however, does electricity furnish the
power by which the brakes are applied; it merely puts in operation
some other power. In one type of electric brake the active
braking force is taken from an axle of each car. A small friction-drum
is made fast to the axle. Another friction-drum hung from
the body of the car swings near the axle. If, when the car is in
motion, these drums are brought in contact, that one which hangs
from the car takes motion from the other, and may be made to
wind a chain on its shaft. Winding in this chain pulls on the
brake-levers precisely as if it had been wound on the shaft of the
hand-brake. The sole function of electricity in this form of brake
is to bring the friction-drums together. In a French brake which
has been used experimentally for some years with much success,
an electric current, controlled by the engine-driver, energizes an
electro-magnet which forms part of the swinging-frame in which the
loose friction-pulley is carried. This electro-magnet being vitalized,
is attracted toward the axle, thus bringing the friction-drums
in contact. In an American brake lately exhibited on a long freight
train, a smaller electro-magnet is used, but the same end is accomplished
by multiplying the power by the intervention of a lever and
wheel. The other type of so-called electric brake is that in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the motive power is compressed air, and the function of the electric
device is simply to manipulate the valves under each car, by
which the air is let into the brake-cylinder or allowed to escape,
thus putting on or releasing the brakes. All of these devices have
this advantage, that, whatever the length of the train, the application
of the brakes is simultaneous on all the wheels, and stops can
be made from high speed with little shock. Up to two years ago
it seemed as if this advantage might be a controlling one, and compel
the introduction of electric brakes for freight service. Since
then the new "quick-acting" form of the air-brake has been developed,
by which the brakes are applied on the rear of a fifty-car
train in two seconds, and there is no longer any necessity to turn
to other devices. It is doubtful, therefore, if the additional complication
of electricity is widely introduced into brake mechanism
for many years, if ever.</p>

<p>It is now universally held that the brake, both for freight and
for passenger service, must be continuous; that is, it must be applied
to every wheel of every car of the train from some one point,
and ordinarily that point must be the engineer's cab. With the
valve of an efficient continuous brake constantly under his left
hand, the engine-driver can play with the heaviest and fastest train.
Without that instrument his work is far more anxious, and much
less certain.</p>

<p>The continuous brake which to-day prevails all over the world,
is the automatic air-brake. In the United States much the largest
part of the rolling stock used in passenger service is equipped
with the Westinghouse automatic brake. A few roads peculiarly
situated use the Eames vacuum-brake. That brake is used on the
elevated roads of New York, and on the Brooklyn bridge roads.
The Westinghouse brake is also largely used in England, on the
Continent of Europe, in India, Australia, and South America. In
the United States it is being rapidly applied to freight cars also.
This brake, therefore, being the highest development of the automatic
air-brake, and the one most widely used, will be briefly described,
as best representing the most approved type of the most
important of all safety appliances.</p>

<p>The general diagram which is given on pages 196&ndash;97 shows
all of the principal parts as applied to a locomotive, a tender, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
passenger car. The diagram is reduced from one prepared by
Mr. M. N. Forney for a new edition of his "Catechism of the
Locomotive." In the plan view are shown very clearly the hand-wheels,
the chains, the rods, and the levers by which the brake
is applied by hand. In passenger service the hand-wheels are
rarely used, but they are retained for convenience in switching
cars in the yard, and for those rare emergencies in which the air-brakes
fail. Under the middle of the car the ordinary pull-rod of
the old hand-brake is cut and two levers are inserted. One lever
is connected with the brake-cylinder, and the other with the piston
which slides in that cylinder. When air is admitted to the
cylinder the piston is driven out, and the brakes are applied
exactly as they would be were the chains wound up by turning the
hand-wheels. Compressed air is supplied to the cylinder from the
reservoir near it, in which pressure is maintained at from 70 to 80
pounds per square inch by a pump placed on one side of the locomotive.
The pump fills the main reservoir on the engine, and also the
car-reservoirs, by means of the train-pipe which extends under all
the cars. When the brakes are off there is a full pressure of air in
all of the car-reservoirs and train-pipes. It is a <em>reduction</em> of the
pressure in the train-pipes which causes the brakes to be applied.</p>

<div class="caption">Plan and Elevation of Air-brake Apparatus.&mdash;Reservoirs and piping in solid black; brake gear shaded.</div>
</div>

<p>This fact must be borne in mind, for it is on this principle that
the automatic action of the brakes depends. If a train parts, or if
the air leaks out of the train-pipe, the brakes go on. This automatic
principle is a vital one in most safety appliances, and it is
secured in the case of the air-brake by one of the most ingenious
little devices that man ever contrived, that is, the triple valve, which
is placed in the piping system between the brake-cylinder and
the car-reservoir. This triple valve has passages to the brake-cylinder,
to the car-reservoir, to the train-pipe, and to the atmosphere.
Which of these passages are open and which are closed
depends upon the position of a piston inside of the triple valve,
and the position of that piston is determined by the difference in
air-pressure on either side of it. Thus, when the pressure in the
train-pipe is greater than that in the car-reservoir, the triple valve
piston is forced over, say to the left, a communication is opened
from the train-pipe to the car-reservoir, and the air pressure in the
latter is restored from the main reservoir on the locomotive. At
the same time a passage is opened from the brake-cylinder to the
atmosphere, the compressed air escapes, the brake-piston is driven
back by a spring, and the brakes are released. If the pressure in
the train-pipe is reduced, the triple-valve piston is driven to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
right (we will assume) by the pressure from the car-reservoir, the
passage to the atmosphere is closed, air flows freely from the car-reservoir
to the brake-cylinder, and the brakes are applied.</p>

<p>The function of the engineer's valve is to control these operations.
Naturally the runner's left hand rests on this instrument,
which is fixed to the back head of the boiler. To apply the brakes
he turns the handle to such a position as to allow air to escape
from the train-pipe; to release, he turns it to allow air to pass
from the main or locomotive reservoir into the train-pipe, and
thence into the car-reservoir. It is hardly necessary to say that
the operation of the brake, which has been described for one car,
is practically simultaneous throughout the train. The brakes on
the driving-wheels of the engine are also automatically applied at
the same time as those of the cars and the tender.</p>

<p>In the plan on <a href="#Page_197">page 197</a> the several different positions of the
handle of the engineer's valve are indicated, and among them the
service-stop and the emergency-stop positions. The quickness of
the stop can be to some degree controlled by the rapidity with
which the air-pressure in the train-pipe is reduced. To make a
stop in the shortest possible time, the runner moves the throttle
lever with his right hand and shuts off steam, and with his left
hand moves the handle of the engineer's valve to the emergency
position, then pulls the sand-rod handle to let sand down to the
rails, and finally, if the engine is not fitted with driver-brakes, he
must reverse the engine and again open the throttle. These
movements must be made in order and with precision; and to
make them instantly and without mistake in the face of sudden
danger requires coolness and presence of mind. It sometimes
happens that an engine-runner reverses his engine before shutting
off steam, in which case the cylinder-heads will very likely be
blown out and the engine be instantly disabled. Then, if there
are no driver-brakes, the locomotive is worse than useless, for instead
of aiding in making the stop, its momentum adds to the work
to be done by the train-brakes. Again, if the air-pressure in the
brake-cylinders is so high, and the adjustment of the levers such
that an instant application of the full pressure will stop the rotation
of the wheels, and cause them to slide on the rails, the stop will
take longer than if the wheels continued to revolve. The maximum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
braking effect is obtained when the pressure on the wheels is as
great as it can be without causing them to slide, and it may happen
that a quicker stop can be made by putting the engineer's
valve to the service-stop position than by trying to make an
emergency-stop. The runner must, therefore, be familiar with the
special conditions of his brakes, and must have that kind of mind
which can be depended upon to work clearly and quickly in a
moment of tremendous responsibility. Fortunately, such minds
are not very rare. The world is full of heroes who want only
discipline, habit, and opportunity.</p>

<p>The pressure of air in the main reservoir and the train-pipe is
maintained by the air-pump on the locomotive, the speed of which
is automatically regulated by an ingenious governor. It is the
throbbing of this vigilant machine which one hears during short
stops at stations. The air-pressure has been reduced in applying
the brakes, and the governor has set the pump at work.</p>

<p>All of those parts of the air-brake apparatus which are shown
in the diagram (<a href="#Page_196">pp. 196&ndash;97</a>) can be easily seen on a train standing
at a station; but the curious traveller must be careful not to
mistake the gas-tank carried under some cars for the car-reservoir.
The gas-tank is about eight feet long; the car-reservoir is
about thirty-three inches.</p>

<p>Although the air-brake can almost talk, it is still not perfect.
There are several fortunes to be made yet in improving it. For
instance, it is desirable, in descending long and steep grades, that
the brake-pressure should be just sufficient to control the speed of
the train, and should be steadily applied; otherwise the descent
will be by a succession of jerks which may become dangerous.
With the automatic the brakes must be occasionally released to recharge
the reservoirs, or when the speed of the train is too much
reduced; and it is difficult to keep a uniform speed. So far, the
means devised to overcome this difficulty and keep a constant and
light pressure on the wheels have been thought too costly or complicated
for general use. With hand-brakes long trains are controlled
by the brakes of but a few of the cars in any one train. It
follows that in the descent of grades the braked wheels must often
run for miles with the pressure as great as it can be without sliding
the wheels. The rim of the wheel is rapidly heated by the friction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of the brake-shoe, and the unequal expansion of the heated and the
unheated parts of the wheel causes a fracture. This is why so
many broken car-wheels are found at the foot of grades&mdash;of all
places the worst for such an accident to happen. With "straight
air," that is, with the pressure from the main reservoir, or the air-pump,
going directly to the brake-cylinder, the engineer can apply
the brakes to all the wheels of his train simultaneously, and with
great delicacy of graduation; and by turning a three-way cock
which is placed in the piping of each car, the air can be used
"straight." This is regularly done on some mountain-roads. At
summits the trains are stopped and the brakes are changed from
"automatic" to "straight." This practice is dangerous, however,
and is not approved by the best brake-experts, for if a hose
bursts, or through some other accident the air in the train-pipe escapes,
the brakes are useless. The automatic arrangement by
which a reduction of air-pressure in the train-pipe applies the
brakes, as previously explained, is much preferred, although no entirely
satisfactory means has yet been devised for automatically
regulating the air-pressure in the brake-cylinder.</p>

<p>There is not space here to enter into the history of the air-brake.
It was first practically applied to passenger trains in 1868.
The first great epoch in its subsequent development was the invention,
by Mr. George Westinghouse, Jr., of the triple valve. The
introduction of the triple valve at once reduced the time of full
application of the brake for a ten-car train from twenty-five seconds
to about eight seconds. This means, at forty miles an hour,
a reduction by more than one thousand feet in the distance in
which a train can be stopped. The next great epoch in the history
of the air-brake was made by the celebrated Burlington brake-trials
of 1886 and 1887. These trials were undertaken by a committee
of the Master Car-builders' Association, to determine whether or
not there was any power-brake fit for freight service. For general
freight service the brake must be capable of arresting a very long
train, with cars loosely coupled, running at a fair average passenger
speed, without producing objectionable shocks in the rear of
the train. The two series of trials were carried out in July, 1886,
and May, 1887. The competing brake-companies brought to the
trials trains of fifty cars each, equipped with their devices. Skilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
mechanical engineers from various railroad and private companies
assisted both years. These trials were most exhaustive, and have
contributed more to the art of braking than any that preceded or
have followed them. The first year's trials developed the fact that
the air-brakes could not be applied on the rear of a fifty-car train
in less than eighteen seconds, whereas the head of a train moving
twenty miles an hour could be completely stopped in fifteen seconds.
The result was that disastrous collisions between the cars of any
one train were produced in the act of stopping. Men in the rear
cars were thrown down and injured, and much damage was done
to the cars. At the end of nineteen days the brake-companies
went home to work another year over the new problem. In 1887
they reappeared on the same ground, and in eighteen days proved
that no simple air-brakes, as then operated, could prevent disastrous
shocks in a long train; but it was shown that by bringing
in electricity to actuate the air-valves, the application of the brakes
could be made practically simultaneous throughout the train. Mr.
Westinghouse, however, during the summer following, made such
modifications in the triple valve and in the train-pipe that he succeeded
in applying the brakes throughout a fifty-car train in two
seconds. That settled the matter. He at once equipped a train
of fifty cars, and in October and November, 1887, that train made
a journey of about three thousand miles, making exhibition stops
at various cities. The journey was a splendid and conclusive demonstration
that the air-brake is now a thoroughly efficient and
reliable contrivance for freight as well as for passenger service.
The result has been a very rapid application of the new quick-acting
brake to freight cars. The performance of this train was to
railroad men most impressive. A freight train of fifty cars is about
one-third of a mile long. To see such a train, running forty miles
an hour, smoothly stopped in one-third of its own length, without
shock or fuss, was an object-lesson that no one could fail to understand
or to remember. Some of the stops made by this train will
give a fair notion of the relative power of hand- and air-brakes
for quick stops. The following figures are averages of stops made
in six different cities. They give the distances run in feet from
the instant of applying the brakes till the train was brought to
a stand-still:</p>

</table></div>

<p>With twenty cars at twenty miles an hour even shorter stops
were made than those recorded above. In the Burlington trials
the hand-brake stops, with fifty-car trains at forty miles an hour,
were made in from two thousand five hundred to three thousand
feet.</p>

</div>

<p>The air-brake is somewhat complicated, but the complicated
mechanism is strong, has little movement, and is securely protected
from dirt and the elements. It is therefore little liable to derangement.
It is, however, becoming better understood that brake-gear
must be good, and employees carefully instructed in the care and
use of the air-brake to get its best results; and in recent years
two or three elaborate instruction-cars have been fitted up for the
education of the enginemen and
trainmen.</p>

<p>Space does not permit more
than an allusion to driver-brakes,
which are operated by steam
and by air. The forms in constant
use are made by the
Eames, the American, the Westinghouse,
and the Beals companies.
Nor can much be said
here of the water-brake, used
to some extent on locomotives
working heavy grades. It consists
of a simple arrangement of
admitting a little hot water, instead
of steam, to the cylinders.
The engine is reversed and the
cylinder-cocks are opened to
the air. The cylinders then act
as air-pumps, and the retarding effect is due to the back pressure.
The use of the water is to prevent overheating of the parts.</p>

<p>If it is important to have efficient means of stopping trains, it is
scarcely less important to have timely information of the need of
stopping them. To give such information is the function of signals,
which, among safety appliances, must
stand next after brakes. Signals fall naturally
into two great classes: Those
which protect points of danger and govern
the movements of engines in yards, and
those which keep an interval of space between
two trains running on one track.
For the protection of switches, crossings,
junctions, and the like, signals in immense
variety have been used, and, unfortunately,
are still used; but
in the last ten or fifteen
years the semaphore
signal has
become the general
standard in the
United States, as it
long has been in
England. This consists
of a board,
called the blade or
arm, pivoted on the
post, and back of the
pivot is a heavy casting
which carries a
colored glass lens,
either green or red.
On the post is hung
a lantern. The danger position is with the blade horizontal. In
this position the lens is in front of the lamp, and the light shows
red or green, as the case may be. The safety position is with the
blade hanging about sixty degrees from the horizontal. In this
position the light of the lantern shows white. Red is the universal
danger color, and green the color of caution. Therefore, a semaphore
signal at a point of danger shows by day a blade painted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
red, with the end of the blade cut square. At night it shows a
red light. At a position some distance from the point of actual
danger, but where it is desirable to warn an engine-runner that
he is likely to find the danger signal against him, a caution signal
is placed. This is a semaphore blade painted green, with the end
notched in a V-shape, or, as it is called, a fish-tail. At night this
signal shows a green light. There is nothing very remarkable
about a piece of board arranged to wag up and down on a pin
stuck through a post, but it is wonderful how much of good brains
and good breath have been expended in getting these boards to
wag harmoniously, and in getting railroad officers to understand
that a plain board, having two possible positions, is a better signal
than any more complicated form.</p>

(Showing two levers and locking mechanism.<br />
<em>A</em> is normal, <em>B</em> is reversed.)</div>
</div>

<p>The arrangement of a group of signals and switches in such a
way that their movements are made
mutually dependent one upon the
other, and so that it is impossible to
make these movements in any but
prearranged sequences, is called, in
railroad vernacular, "interlocking,"
and in this sense the word will be
used here. Interlocking has become
a special art. The objects which it
is sought to accomplish by interlocking,
and the admirable way in which
those objects are attained, may best
be understood from an actual example.
For that purpose we shall take
a double-track junction completely
equipped with signals, facing-point
locks, and derailing switches (<a href="#Page_205">p. 205</a>).</p>

<p>A general view of an interlocking
frame was given on <a href="#Page_171">page 171</a> of this
volume. Two levers from such a
frame are here shown. The normal
position of the levers is forward, as lever <em>A</em>. When pulled back,
as lever <em>B</em>, the lever is said to be reversed.</p>

<p>Let it be supposed that a main-line train is to be passed eastward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
in the direction of the arrow <em>B</em>. The first movement of the
signalman in the signal-tower would naturally be to lower signals
1 and 2. He attempts to pull over lever 1, but cannot move it,
and, in spite of any effort or ingenuity on his part, that signal remains
at danger. The reason is that lever 2 when normal locks
lever 1 normal. The logic of this will be at once apparent.
Clearing signal 1 is an indication to the engineer that the way is
clear, and that he may pass the junction at speed. So long as this
signal (which, it must be remembered, is a <em>caution</em> signal) stands
at danger he knows that he may pass it, but must be ready to stop
before he reaches No. 2, the home-signal. Therefore No. 1 must
never be lowered till all is arranged for passing the junction at
speed. As the signalman cannot lower signal 1, he attempts to
lower signal 2. Again he finds that he cannot budge the lever.
It is locked by lever No. 3. This lever works a facing-point lock,
which must be described just at this point (<a href="#Page_206">p. 206</a>).</p>

<p><em>A</em> is the west-bound main line track; <em>B</em>, the east-bound; <em>C</em> and <em>D</em> are the west-bound
and east-bound branch-tracks. Nos. 1, 10, and 12 are distant signals; Nos. 2,
9, and 11, home signals; Nos. 3, 6, and 8, facing-point locks; and Nos. 4, 5, and 7
are switches. The levers which move all of these parts are placed side by side in a frame in the signal-tower. It will
be noticed that No. 7 is a switch designed merely to derail an engine on track A. A similar switch is provided on
track <em>C</em>, and is worked by the same lever which works junction switch No. 5. In the sketch all levers are supposed to
stand in their "normal" position, all signals are at danger, and the switches are set for the main line. The switches
themselves are not locked in this position of the facing-point lock levers.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The front rod of the switch, that is, the rod which connects the
points of the two moving rails of the switch, is pierced with two
holes placed a distance apart just equal to the throw of the switch.
In front of these holes is a bolt which is worked by a lever in the
signal-tower. After the switch is set the lock-lever is reversed
and the bolt enters one of the holes, thus securely locking the
switch in position. There is one other interesting feature of this
facing-point lock. It has happened very often that a switch has
been thrown under a moving train, splitting the train and derailing
more or less of it. This class of accidents is especially likely to
happen when train movements are very frequent, and may be prevented
by the use of the "detector-bar." This is a bar about forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
feet long, placed alongside the rail, and carried on swinging links,
like those of a parallel ruler, in such a way that any effort to move
the bar lengthwise of the rail must raise it above the top of the
rail. This bar is moved by the same lever which moves the locking-bolt.
So long as there is a wheel on the rail above the detector-bar
it cannot be moved, therefore the locking-bolt cannot be
withdrawn, and the switch cannot be moved until the train has
passed completely off it.</p>

<p>We left the signalman trying to lower signal No. 2; vainly, because
No. 3 lever was still normal and the switch unlocked (Diagram,
p. 205). Probably he would not have begun his operations
in the bungling way that has
been supposed, but would have
first reversed lever 3. That
locks the switch by the facing-point
lock, and locks also
switch-lever 4 in the frame in
the signal-tower and releases
lever 2. Then he reverses
lever 2. That locks lever 3
and releases lever 1. Then he
reverses lever 1, which locks
lever 2. Now the way is made
for a train to pass east on the
main line, and the signals are
clear. The last signal could
not have been lowered until
the chain of operations was complete; none of the levers can now
be moved until lever 1 is again put normal and signal 1 made
to show danger. There is one point of great danger in this particular
train-movement which has not been mentioned; that is, the
crossing of main-line east-bound track <em>B</em> by the branch-line west-bound
track <em>C</em>. It will be noticed that with the levers normal, derailing
switch 5 is open, and it is impossible for a locomotive to
pass beyond it. Lever 5 is interlocked in the tower with lever 4
in such a way that, before 5 can be reversed to let a train pass
west from <em>C</em>, lever 4 must be reversed to trap any train on <em>B</em> and
turn it down the branch <em>D</em>. It must not be understood that the
use of "derailers" is universal. In fact, they are not recommended
by the best signal engineers, except in special conditions. In the
absence of derailer No. 5, signals 11 and 12 would be interlocked
with switch 4, so that, so long as that switch stands open for the
main line a clear signal cannot be given to a train coming west on
<em>C</em>. It will be noticed that signal 2 carries two semaphores on one
post. The upper one is for the main line and the lower one for
the branch. Both are operated by one lever, 2, and whether reversing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
lever 2 lowers the main-line signal or the branch signal
depends on the position of the switch. The switch is made to pick
out its signal by an ingenious but very simple little arrangement,
called a selector, which is placed somewhere in the line of ground
connections.</p>

<p>It would be an interesting study, were there space, to follow
the possible and proper combinations of movements to pass trains
over the various tracks. It will be seen that, by concentrating the
levers which move switches and signals in one place and interlocking
them, it is made mechanically impossible for a signalman
to give a signal which would lead to a collision or a derailment
within the region under his control. The only danger at such
points is that an engineer may overrun the signals. This description
of the objects and the capacity of the system of interlocking is
no fancy sketch. The system has been in use for many years,
doing just what has been here described, and more. A recent
close estimate gave the number of interlocked levers now in use in
the United States as about eight thousand, and the number is rapidly
increasing. Recent official reports showed that in Great
Britain and Ireland there were thirty-eight thousand cases in which
a passenger line was connected with or crossed by another line,
siding, or cross-over. In eighty-nine per cent. of these cases the
levers operating the switches and protecting signals were interlocked.</p>

<p>The example of interlocking which has been given is one of the
simplest; the principle is capable of almost indefinite expansion,
and any one lever may be made to lock any one or more levers
among hundreds in the same frame. The greatest number of
levers assembled in any one signal-tower in this country is one
hundred and sixteen, at the Grand Central Station in New York.
In the London Bridge tower there are two hundred and eighty
levers. This is probably the greatest number in any one tower in
the world. All of these levers may be more or less interlocked.
The same principle is applied to the locking of two levers at a single
switch, and to the protection of drawbridges and highway
crossings.</p>

<p>The mechanism by which the interlocking is done is strong and
comparatively simple, but a detailed description of it seems out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
place here. Two levers from a Saxby &amp; Farmer machine are
shown on <a href="#Page_204">page 204</a>, with lever <em>A</em> normal and <em>B</em> reversed. The
locking mechanism is in front of the levers, and is actuated not by
the levers themselves, but by their catch-rods. It follows that it is
not the actual movement of a signal which prevents the movement
of other signals, or of switches, but it is the intention to move that
signal. This principle of "preliminary locking" is one of great
importance.</p>

<p>Switches and signals are often worked at such distances from
the tower that it is impossible for the operator to know whether or
not the movement contemplated has taken place. The British
Board of Trade does not permit switches to be worked more than
750 feet away. In this country there is no limit, but probably 800
feet is very rarely exceeded. Signals are worked in England up
to 3,000 or 3,500 feet very commonly, and they are even worked
a mile away, but not satisfactorily. This is with direct mechanical
connection, by rod or wire, from the levers. It is obvious that a
break in the connections between the lever and the switch or
signal might take place, and the lever be pulled over, without having
produced the corresponding movement at the far end. The
locking mechanism in the tower would not be affected by such an
accident, and consequently conflicting signals might be given.
Even this contingency is provided against with almost perfect
safety. If a signal connection breaks, the signal is counter-weighted
to go to danger. The worst that can happen is to delay
traffic. If a switch connection breaks, the locking-bolt, in the
latest form of facing-point lock, will not enter the hole in the
switch-rod, and consequently warning is given in the tower that
the switch has not moved. Electric annunciators are often placed
in the signal-tower, to show on a board before the operator
whether or not the movements of switches and signals have taken
place.</p>

<p>Considerable work must be done in the movement of each
lever. The ground connections must be put down with great care,
as nearly straight and level as may be, well drained, and protected
from ice and snow. All of these difficulties have been overcome
in a beautiful pneumatic interlocking apparatus which has been introduced
within the last two or three years. In this system the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
motive power is compressed air. Near each switch is a small
cylinder, containing a piston which is attached directly to the
switch movement. Compressed air admitted to one side or the
other of this piston moves the switch one way or the other. But,
as it would take some time for the necessary quantity of air to flow
from the signal-tower to a distant switch, a small reservoir is
placed near the switch, and the air from this reservoir is admitted
to one end or the other of the switch cylinder according to the
position of a valve. For transmitting the motion from the tower
to the valve compressed air might be used, but, as air is elastic, a
quicker movement is got by using in the pipes some liquid which
does not readily freeze, and which, being practically non-compressible,
transmits an impulse given at one end almost instantly to
the other. The signals are worked in essentially the same manner
as the switches, except that the pneumatic valves are moved by
electricity. The tower apparatus of a pneumatic system in the
yard of the Pennsylvania Railroad at Pittsburg is shown in the
engraving opposite. In the front of the apparatus is seen a rank
of small handles, which can be turned from side to side with as
much ease as the keys of a piano can be depressed. Turning one
of these handles admits compressed air to the end of a pipe containing
liquid. Instantly the pressure is transmitted 500 or 1,000
feet to the valve at the switch to be moved. The small levers are
interlocked perfectly, and in that particular perform the duties of
the ordinary machine. A model of the tracks controlled is placed
before the operator, showing the switches and signals, and when
a movement is made on the ground it is at once repeated back by
electricity and duplicated on the model. This beautiful system is
due to the same genius that gave us the perfected air-brake and
the triple valve, and is the greatest improvement that has been
made in interlocking in the last dozen years.</p>

<p>If the reader has grasped the full significance of interlocking,
he understands that it makes it impossible to give a signal that
would lead to a collision or to a derailment at a misplaced switch.
The worst that a stupid, or drunken, or malicious signalman could
do would be to delay traffic, if the signals were obeyed. Here
comes in the failing case. The brake-power may be insufficient
to stop a train after a danger signal is given. That is a rare occurrence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
but may happen. The engineer may not see the danger
signal because of fog, or he may carelessly run past it. Provision
against a failure to see and to obey a signal may be made by placing
on the track a torpedo, which will explode with a loud report
when struck by a wheel. The
use of hand-torpedoes in fogs,
and for emergencies in places
unprovided with fixed signals,
is very common. These are
little disks filled with a detonating
powder, and provided with
tin straps that are bent down to
clasp over the top of the rail.
A simple and very efficient torpedo
machine, which has been
used for some years on the
Manhattan Elevated and elsewhere,
is here shown. This
machine has a magazine holding
five torpedoes. It is connected to a signal-lever in such a
way that, when the signal is put to danger, one torpedo is placed
in a position to be exploded by the first passing wheel. When the
signal returns to the clear position the torpedo, if unexploded, is
withdrawn to the magazine. If the torpedo is exploded another
one takes its place at the next movement of the signal-lever. One
of these machines on the Elevated Road moves about five thousand
times every day. In such a case a torpedo would soon be
worn out if it was not exploded or frequently changed. When
this apparatus is in operation, an unmistakable alarm is at once
given to the engineer and to others if a danger signal is passed.
On the Manhattan Elevated lines an engineman who overruns a
danger signal and can show no good reason for it is suspended
for the first offence, and discharged for the second. The torpedo
makes it impossible for him to escape detection.</p>

</div>

<p>The second great class of signals comprises those which are
intended to keep fixed intervals of space between trains running
on the same track. These are block signals. The block system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
is used on a few of the
railroads of the United
States which have the
heaviest and fastest
traffic. Much the most
common practice in this
country, however, is to
run trains by time intervals,
and under the
constant control of the
train despatcher. In
England the block system
is almost universal.
About ninety per cent.
of all the passenger
lines of that country are
worked under the absolute
block system.</p>

<p>When the block system
is not used, it is
quite common to protect
particularly dangerous
points, such as
curves and deep cuts,
by stationing watchmen
there with flags or with
some form of fixed signal.
The watchman can notify an approaching engine-runner
that a preceding train has or has not passed beyond his own range
of vision; or can notify him that it has been gone a certain time.
Travellers by the Philadelphia &amp; Reading must have noticed
the queer structures, with revolving vanes on top, looking like a
feeble sort of windmill, which appear in positions to command a
view of cuts, curves, etc. These are examples of the devices for
local protection. The non-automatic block signal develops naturally
from the protection of scattered points. Instead of placing
watchmen at points of especial danger, they are placed at regular
intervals of one mile, two miles, or five miles. Instead of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
watchman looking to see that a train has disappeared from his
field of vision before he lets another train pass, he uses the eyes
of the next watchman ahead, who telegraphs back that the train
has passed his station. Suppose A, B, and C to be three block-signal
stations placed at intervals of two miles. When a train
passes A, the operator at that point at once puts a signal to danger
behind it. This signal stands at danger until the train passes B,
and the operator puts his signal to danger, and telegraphs back to
A to announce that train No. 1 has passed out of the block A B,
and is protected by the signal at B. Then, and not until then, the
operator clears the signal at A and allows train No. 2 to enter the
block. Meanwhile train No. 1 is proceeding through the block
B C, its rear protected at B; and the same sequence of events
happens when it arrives at C as happened at B. This is the simplest
form of block signalling. In the more elaborate form there
are at each block-station three signals&mdash;the distant, the home, and
the starting. The signals are often electrically interlocked, from
one station to another, in such a way that it is mechanically impossible
for the operator at A to give a signal for a train to pass that
station until the signal at B has been put to danger behind the
preceding train.</p>

<div class="center">
<br />
A<span class="pad10">B</span><span class="pad10">C</span><br />
<hr class="chapa" />
<br />
</div>

<p>It is seen that no two trains can be in the same block and on
the same track at the same time. If all run at a uniform speed,
they will be kept just the length of a block apart. If No. 2 is
faster than No. 1, it will arrive at B before No. 1 gets to C, but
will have to wait there. The block system, therefore, while it
gives security, does not always facilitate traffic. The longer the
blocks the greater will be the delay to trains; but the shorter the
blocks, the greater the cost of establishment, maintenance, and
operation.</p>

<p>Various systems have been contrived to have block signals displayed
automatically by the passage of trains. This, if it can be
done reliably, will do away with the wages of part of the operators,
and will also eliminate the dangers arising from human carelessness.
But there are very great objections to relying solely upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the automatic action of signals, and automatic block signals are
little used except as auxiliary to a system employing operators
also. So used, they are of decided advantage, as they make sure
that a danger signal is set behind every train in spite of the operator,
and that it cannot be again set to the all-clear position till
the train has passed out of the block. All this is accomplished by
electricity.</p>

<p>Brakes, interlocking, and the apparatus of signalling have been
considered at length because they are very much the most important
of all the appliances which go to increase the safety of operating
railroads. They act chiefly to prevent collisions, but often prevent
or mitigate accidents from derailments and other causes. Of
all train-accidents happening in the last sixteen years, over one-third
have been from collisions, and more than one-half from derailments.</p>

<div class="caption">Crossing Gates worked by Mechanical Connection from the Cabin.</div>
</div>

<p>After brakes and signals, the devices next in importance as
means of saving life are those for the protection of highway crossings
at the grade of railroads. In years to come, as wealth increases
and as traffic becomes more crowded, we may suppose
there will be few such crossings; but their abolition must be slow,
and meantime the loss of life at them is great. The most accurate
and complete statistics bearing on this matter are those collected
by the Railroad Commissioners of Massachusetts. In 1888, of all
those killed in the operation of the railroads of the State, seven per
cent. were passengers, thirty-three per cent. were employees, and
sixty per cent. were others. The others include trespassers, forty-seven
per cent.; and killed at grade crossings, eleven per cent.
More trespassers were killed than any other class; but the deaths
at highway crossings considerably exceeded those among passengers.
The difficulty of preventing this class of accidents is strikingly
shown by the fact that, of all crossing accidents, forty-two per
cent. were due to the victims' disregard of warnings given by closed
gates or flags. It is evident that the efforts of the railroad companies
to save people's lives at crossings are largely nullified by the
carelessness of the public, and the lack of proper laws to punish
those who venture upon railroad tracks when they should keep off
them. Still, it remains the duty and the policy of the railroads to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
protect street crossings by all practicable means. The best protection
is afforded by gates with watchmen, and of all forms of
gate the most common, because it is the simplest and most convenient
to operate, is the familiar arm-gate. This is usually worked
by a man turning a crank, but it is also worked by compressed air.
On this page is shown a group of gates worked from an elevated
cabin by a mechanical connection. A bell fixed at a crossing, to
be rung by an approaching train, is a very useful auxiliary to gates
and to watchmen with flags, and is considerably used where the
traffic does not warrant the expense of maintaining a watchman.
There are several good devices of this sort, either electric or magneto-electric.
One of the latter class has a lever alongside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
rail, which is depressed by each wheel that passes over it. This
lever is geared to a fly-wheel, which is set rapidly revolving and
causes an armature to revolve in the field of a magnet, and thus
generates a current and rings a gong, precisely as is done with the
familiar magnetic bell used with the telephone.</p>

<div class="caption">Wreck at a Bridge.</div>
</div>

<p>About thirteen per cent. of the train-accidents in the United
States, in the last sixteen years, were derailments due to defects
of road. These include not only defective rails, switches, and
frogs, but bridge wrecks. There are, however, few devices used
in the track, other than those already mentioned, that can be called
safety appliances. This class of accidents is to be provided against
only by good material, good workmanship, and unceasing care.
Many so-called safety switches and safety frogs are offered to railroad
officers, but those actually in wide use are confined to a very
few standard forms. The split-switch, which is shown in the engravings
on pages 206 and 207, has gradually replaced the old
stub-switch, as well as most of the "safety" switches that have
been from time to time introduced; although the stub-switch is
still in considerable use in yards where movements are slow, and
in the main tracks of the less progressive roads. It consists of a
pair of moving rails the ends of which are brought opposite to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
ends of the main-line rails, or to those of the turnout, as the case
may be. It follows that but one of these tracks is continuous at
any one time, and a train reaching the switch by the other track
must be derailed. The distressing accident which happened at
Rio, Wis., in 1886, where seventeen people lost their lives, was a derailment
of this sort. Since that time the railroad on which the accident
happened has taken out all stub-switches on thousands of
miles of main-line track. The split-switch provides against such
derailments, for if the switch is set for the turnout, and a train
approaches it from the main line in the "trailing" direction, the
flanges of the wheels move the switch-rails to make the track
continuous. The terms "facing" and "trailing," as applied to
switches, are almost self-explanatory. If a train approaches toward
the points of the moving rails, the switch is said to be facing.
If it runs through the switch from the rear of the moving
rails, the switch is said to be trailing. This will be made clear
by reference to the illustration on <a href="#Page_206">page 206</a>. If a train were coming
from the bridge, the first switch reached by it would be a
trailing and the second a facing switch. In the newspaper reports
an accident will very often be assigned to one of two causes, failure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of the air-brakes or spreading of the rails. The chances are that
it will be found on investigation to be due to neither of these
causes. Those interested to maintain the credit of the air-brake
or of the track department are not often on the ground when the
reporter gets his information, and the temptation is always great
to shift the responsibility to the shoulders of the absent. Probably
the displacement of the rail will have taken place after the derailment;
but rails do sometimes spread. Loose spikes and rotten
ties allow the outer edge of the rail-flange to sink into the wood,
and the rail to roll outward enough to let the wheels drop. Sound
ties are the first safeguard against such accidents. Metal plates
under the rails are useful also; but one of the most efficient means
of preventing displacement of the rails is the interlocking bolt
shown above. These bolts cross in the timber, and slots cut in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the two bolts engage with each other in such a way that when the
nuts are screwed down on the rail-flange it is impossible to pull
the bolts out. They can only be moved by tearing through the
wood contained in the angle between them. This bolt is much
used on bridges and trestles, where it is of vital importance that
the rails should be held in place and no part of the floor broken.</p>

<div class="caption">New South Norwalk Drawbridge. Rails held by safety bolts.</div>
</div>

<p>In 1853 an express train went through an open draw at South
Norwalk, Conn., and forty-six lives were lost. This, one of the
most serious railroad accidents that ever happened, is still remembered
as an historical calamity. The bridge which stands on the
same site is shown opposite. In May, 1888, a west-bound express
train, consisting of an engine and seven cars, was derailed just as
it was entering the draw-span. The train ran three hundred feet
on the sleepers before it was stopped. Then it was found that all
of the driving-wheels of the engine had regained the rails, but all
the other wheels were off, except those of two sleeping-cars in
the rear. This was a remarkable escape from a bad accident, and
much of the credit of it has been given to the interlocking bolts
with which the rails were fastened. They are supposed to have prevented
the rails being crowded aside, and thus to have made possible
the rerailing of the engine. Besides, they helped the oak
guard-timbers to hold the ties in place. The destruction of a
bridge in an accident frequently begins by the ties bunching in
front of the wheels and allowing the wheels to drop through and
strike the floor-beams below. For this reason guard-timbers,
notched down over the ties, should always be used.</p>

<div class="caption">Engines Wrecked during the Great Wabash Strike.</div>
</div>

<p>The traveller will have noticed, on all bridges of various roads,
two rails placed inside the track-rails, and curved to meet in a point
at either end of the bridge. These are known as inside guard-rails,
and their function is to keep derailed trucks in line till the
train can be stopped. Besides the bunching of the ties, there is
danger in a bridge derailment that a truck may swing around and
strike one of the trusses. Then the bridge is very likely to be
wrecked. A further provision for the protection of bridges is the
rerailing frog invented by the late Charles Latimer, whose name
is dear to railroad men all over America. This consists of a pair
of castings combined with inside guard-rails, designed to raise the
derailed wheels and guide them on to the rails. There is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
doubt that it has prevented several wrecks, although it has never
been widely used. The subject of bridges should not be left without
a word of explanation of the stout timber-posts often seen at
either end placed in line with the trusses. These are designed to
stop any derailed vehicle which might otherwise strike against and
destroy a truss.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is one track-fixture that has no duty or value except as
it promotes safety. It helps only one humble class of railroad employees.
That device is the foot-guard. At all places where two
rails cross or approach each other, as at frogs and guard-rails,
dangerous boot-jacks are formed by the rail-heads. The overhang
of the heads of the rail makes it easy for one to so fasten his foot
in one of those boot-jacks that it is hard to get it out. If a man
finds himself in this position in front of an approaching train, he
sometimes has the alternative of standing up to be struck by the
engine or lying down and having his foot cut off. Fortunately
this class of accidents is comparatively rare; probably not more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
than two or three per cent. of all deaths and injuries to passengers
and employees is caused in this way. Nevertheless, the means of
guarding against accidents of this class is so cheap that it should
be more generally adopted than it is. It consists simply in partly
filling the space between the rail-heads by putting in wooden
blocks or strips of metal, or even packing with cinders, gravel, or
any sort of ballast. Various wooden and metal foot-guards have
been patented. They are all too simple to require description.</p>

<p>Of all accidents to employees the most numerous are those
which arise in coupling and uncoupling cars. In Massachusetts, in
1888, the employees killed and injured were 391; of these casualties
154 occurred in coupling accidents. The commissioners of
other States, especially of Iowa, have for years published statistics
showing nearly the same ratio. Fortunately accidents of this class,
although numerous, are not proportionately fatal. Far the greater
part of them result in the loss of part of a hand; but they are so
frequent as to have caused much discussion, legislation, and invention.
Several States have, one time and another, passed laws requiring
the use of automatic couplers; and two or three years ago
there were on record in the United States over four thousand
coupler patents. The laws have been futile because impracticable;
and most of the patents have been worthless for the same reason.
It was obvious that the business of supplying couplers for the one
million freight cars of the country could not be put into the hands
of some one patentee unless his device was manifestly and pre-eminently
superior to all others. It became important, therefore,
to select as a standard some type of coupler general enough to include
the patents of various men, and at the same time so definite
that all couplers made to conform to the standard could work together
interchangeably. Those who read Mr. Voorhees' story<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
of the wanderings of a freight car will understand that any one
freight car in the United States or Canada should be prepared to
run in the same train with any other car. A few years ago a committee
of the Master Car-builders' Association was appointed to
choose and recommend a type of coupler to be adopted as the
standard of the association. After prolonged and careful study of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the subject, the committee recommended the type of which the
Janney is the best known example, and that has now become the
standard of the association. This
action does not give a monopoly to
the Janney company, as there are already
half a dozen couplers which
conform to the type. This coupler
is shown by diagrams in the article
by M. N. Forney, <a href="#Page_142">page 142</a>. A perspective
view is herewith given. This
device couples automatically, and thus
does away with the necessity for the
brakeman going between the cars.
It can also be unlocked by the rod
shown extending to the side of the
car, and the locking device can be set
not to couple, to facilitate switching
and yard work. The mechanical principles of this coupler are a
great and important improvement upon any form of link-and-pin
coupler; and the coupler question has now come to this point:
A type of coupler has been selected by a technical body representing
most of the railroads of the United States. It is general
enough to avoid the
evils of a patent monopoly.
It promises
to be economical in
operation, and will
certainly do away
with the terrible loss
of life and limb which
results from the use
of the non-automatic
coupler. The railroads
are adopting it
with reasonable
speed, perhaps, but
not as rapidly as simple considerations of humanity would dictate.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_224b.jpg" width="350" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Janney Automatic Coupler applied to a Freight Car.</div>
</div>

<p>Closely related to the coupler is the vestibule, which within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
last two years has become so fashionable. The vestibule is not
merely a luxury, but has a certain value as a safety device.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The
full measure of this value has not yet been proved. Occasionally
lives are lost by passengers falling from or being blown from the
platforms of moving trains. Such accidents the vestibule will prevent,
and, further, it decreases the oscillation of the cars, and thus
to some degree helps to prevent derailment. It is also some protection
against telescoping. A few months ago a coal train on a
double-track road was derailed, and four cars were thrown across
in front of a solid vestibule train of seven Pullman cars approaching
on the other track. The engine of the vestibuled train was
completely wrecked. Even the sheet-iron jacket was stripped
off it. The engineer and fireman were instantly killed, but not
another person on the train was injured. They escaped partly because
the cars were strong, and partly, doubtless, because the
vestibules helped to keep the platforms on the same level and in
line, and thus to prevent crushing of the ends of the cars.</p>

</div>

<p>The number of passengers burned in wrecks is greatly exaggerated
in the public mind; but that fate is so horrible that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
not wonderful that "the deadly car-stove" should be the object of
persistent and energetic attacks by the press and in State legislatures.
The result has been the development, in the last three
years, of the entirely new business of inventing and trying to sell
systems of heating by steam or hot water from the locomotive, and
even by electricity. In fact, the manufacture of such apparatus has
already become an industry of some importance, several thousand
cars being equipped with it. This whole matter of steam-heating
is still in a somewhat crude state, and it does not seem desirable to
force it by legislation. It has been demonstrated that it is the
cheapest way of heating trains, and the most easily regulated; and
it has become a good advertisement to attract passengers. Consequently
the whole subject may be safely left in the hands of the
railroad companies, and allowed to develop itself naturally in a
business way. There is not yet any system of continuous heating
so perfected that a railroad company could without hardship be
compelled to adopt it for all its passenger equipment.</p>

<p>Fires in wrecked trains have originated probably quite as often
from kerosene lamps as from the stoves. The danger of fire from
this source, and the desire to give passengers the luxury of
sufficient light, have led to methods of lighting by gas and, more
recently by electricity. Lighting by compressed gas ceased years
ago to be an experiment. In Germany it is almost universal, but
in this country it has been brought into use very slowly. The
system is almost absolutely safe, not unreasonably expensive, and
may be made to give satisfactory and even brilliant illumination;
but the ideal light for railroad trains will probably be found in
electricity. It is even safer than gas, and is the most adaptable of
any known method of lighting. Some sleeping-cars that have been
recently put in service on the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway
are provided with small electric lamps in the sides of the car,
between each two adjoining seats, so that the occupants can read
comfortably either when sitting in their seats or lying in their
berths.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is not to be supposed that so large a subject as that of safety
appliances can be exhaustively treated within the limits of one
article. It has been thought best, therefore, to give most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
space available to the two or three devices of greatest and most
useful application. There remain various others that are in daily
use, and that have important offices, which have not even been
mentioned. If the reader has gleaned from these very incomplete
notes some clearer notions than he had before of the means by
which the power of the locomotive is guided into safe and useful
paths, the writer's object has been accomplished.</p>

<p class="p1 drop-cap">From the time when Puck was supposed to
utter his boast to put a girdle round about
the earth in forty minutes to the time when
Jules Verne's itinerant hero accomplished the
task in twice that number of days, the restless
ingenuity and energy of man have been unceasingly
taxed to increase the speed, comfort, and safety
of passenger travel. The first railway on which passengers
were carried was the "Stockton &amp; Darlington," of England,
the distance being 12 miles. It was opened September 27,
1825, with a freight train, or, as it is called in England, a "goods"
train, but which also carried a number of excursionists. An engine
which was the result of many years of labor and experiment on the
part of George Stephenson was used on this train. Stephenson
mounted it and acted as driver; his bump of caution was evidently
largely developed, for, to guard against accidents from the recklessness
of the speed, he arranged to have a signalman on horse-back
ride in advance of the engine to warn the luckless trespasser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of the fate which awaited him if he should get in the way of a
train moving with such a startling velocity. The next month,
October, it was decided that it would be worth while to attempt
the carrying of passengers, and a daily "coach," modelled after
the stage-coach and called the "Experiment," was put on, Monday,
October 10, 1825, which carried six passengers inside and
from fifteen to twenty outside. The engine with its light load
made the trip in about two hours. The fare from Stockton to
Darlington was one shilling, and each passenger was allowed fourteen
pounds of baggage. The limited amount of baggage will appear
to the ladies of the present day as niggardly in the extreme,
but they must recollect that the
bandbox was then the popular
form of portmanteau for women,
the Saratoga trunk had not been
invented, and the muscular baggage-smasher
of modern times
had not yet set out upon his
career of destruction. The advertisement
which was published
in the newspapers of the day is here given, and is of peculiar interest
as announcing the first successful attempt to carry passengers by rail.</p>

<p>The Liverpool &amp; Manchester road was opened in 1829.
The first train was hauled by an improved engine called the
"Rocket," which attained a speed of 25 miles an hour, and some
records put it as high as 35 miles. This speed naturally attracted
marked attention in the mechanical world, and first demonstrated
the superior advantages of railways for passenger travel. Only
four years before, so eminent a writer upon railways as Wood had
said: "Nothing can do more harm to the adoption of railways
than the promulgation of such nonsense as that we shall see locomotives
travelling at the rate of 12 miles an hour."</p>

<p>America was quick to adopt the railway system which had had
its origin in England. In 1827 a crude railway was opened between
Quincy and Boston, but it was only for the purpose of transporting
granite for the Bunker Hill Monument. It was not until
August, 1829, that a locomotive engine was used upon an American
railroad suitable for carrying passengers. This road was constructed
by the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Company, and the
experiment was made near Honesdale, Pa. The engine was imported
from England and was called the "Stourbridge Lion."</p>

<p>In May, 1830, the first division of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio road
was opened. It extended from Baltimore to Ellicott's Mills, a distance
of 15 miles. There being a scarcity of cars, the regular passenger
business did not begin till the 5th of July following, and
then only horse-power was employed, which continued to be used
till the road was finished to Frederick, in 1832. The term Relay
House, the name of a well-known station, originated in the fact
that the horses were changed at that place.</p>

<p>The following notice, which appeared in the Baltimore newspapers,
was the first time-table for passenger railway trains published
in this country:</p>


<p class="p2 pfs80">RAILROAD NOTICE.</p>

<div class="blockquoty">

<p>A sufficient number of cars being now provided for the accommodation of passengers,
notice is hereby given that the following arrangements for the arrival and departure of carriages
have been adopted, and will take effect on and after Monday morning next the 5th
instant, viz.:</p>

<p>A brigade of cars will leave the depot on Pratt St. at 6 and 10 o'clock A. M., and at 3
to 4 o'clock P. M., and will leave the depot at Ellicott's Mills at 6 and 8½ o'clock A. M.,
and at 12½ and 6 P. M.</p>

<p>Way passengers will provide themselves with tickets at the office of the Company in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Baltimore, or at the depots at Pratt St. and Ellicott's Mills, or at the Relay House, near
Elk Ridge Landing.</p>

<p>The evening way car for Ellicott's Mills will continue to leave the depot, Pratt St., at
6 o'clock P. M. as usual.</p>

<p>N. B. Positive orders have been issued to the drivers to receive no passengers into
any of the cars without tickets.</p>

<p>P. S. Parties desiring to engage a car for the day can be accommodated after July 5th.</p></div>

<p>It will be seen that the word train was not used, but instead
the schedule spoke of a "brigade of cars."</p>

<p>The South Carolina Railroad was begun about the same time
as the Baltimore &amp; Ohio, and ran from Charleston to Hamburg,
opposite Augusta. When the first division had been constructed,
it was opened November 2, 1830.</p>

<p>Peter Cooper, of New York, had before this constructed a locomotive
and made a trial trip with it on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio
Railroad, on the 28th of August, 1830, but, not meeting the requirements
of the company, it was not put into service.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_231.jpg" width="350" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Mohawk &amp; Hudson Train.</div>
</div>

<p>A passenger train of the Mohawk &amp; Hudson Railroad which
was put on in October,
1831, between Albany
and Schenectady, attracted
much attention.
It was hauled
by an English engine
named the "John
Bull," and driven by
an English engineer named John Hampson. This is generally
regarded as the first fully equipped passenger train hauled by a
steam-power engine which ran in regular service in America.
During 1832 it carried an average of 387 passengers daily. The
accompanying engraving is from a sketch made at the time.</p>

<p>It was said by an advocate of mechanical evolution that the
modern steam fire-engine was evolved from the ancient leathern
fire-bucket; it might be said with greater truth that the modern
railway car has been evolved from the old-fashioned English stage-coach.</p>

<p>England still retains the railway carriage divided into compartments,
that bear a close resemblance inside and outside to stage-coach
bodies with the middle seat omitted. In fact, the nomen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>clature
of the stage-coach is in large measure still preserved in
England. The engineer is called the driver, the conductor the
guard, the ticket-office is the booking-office, the cars are the carriages,
and a rustic traveller may still be heard occasionally to object
to sitting with his back to the horses. The earlier locomotives,
like horses, were given proper names, such as Lion, North Star,
Fiery, and Rocket; the compartments in the round-houses for
sheltering locomotives are termed the stalls, and the keeper of the
round-house is called the hostler. The last two are the only items
of equine classification which the American railway system has
permanently adopted.</p>

<div class="caption">English Railway Carriage, Midland Road. First and Third Class and Luggage Compartments.</div>
</div>

<p>America, at an early day, departed not only from the nomenclature
of the turnpike, but from the stage-coach architecture, and
adopted a long car in one compartment and containing a middle
aisle which admitted of communication throughout the train.
The car was carried on two trucks, or bogies, and was well adapted
to the sharp curvature which prevailed upon our railways.</p>

<p>The first five years of experience showed marked progress in
the practical operation of railway trains, but even after locomotives
had demonstrated their capabilities and each improved engine had
shown an encouraging increase in velocity, the wildest flights of
fancy never pictured the speed attained in later years.</p>

<p>When the roads forming the line between Philadelphia and
Harrisburg, Pa., were chartered in 1835, and town meetings were
held to discuss their practicability, the Honorable Simon Cameron,
while making a speech in advocacy of the measure, was so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
carried away by
his enthusiasm
as to make the
rash prediction
that there were
persons within
the sound of his
voice who would
live to see a
passenger take
his breakfast in
Harrisburg and
his supper in
Philadelphia on the same day. A friend of his on the platform
said to him after he had finished: "That's all very well, Simon,
to tell to the boys, but you and I are no such infernal fools as to
believe it." They both lived to travel the distance in a little over
two hours.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<div class="caption">Bogie Truck.</div>
</div>

<p>The people were far from being unanimous in their advocacy
of the railway system, and charters were not obtained without severe
struggles. The topic was the universal subject of discussion
in all popular assemblages. Colonel Blank, a well-known politician
in Pennsylvania, had been loud in his opposition to the new
means of transportation. When one of the first trains was running
over the Harrisburg &amp; Lancaster road, a famous Durham bull
belonging to a Mr. Schultz became seized with the enterprising
spirit of Don Quixote,
put his head down and
tail up, and made a
desperate charge at
the on-coming locomotive,
but his steam-breathing
opponent
proved the better butter
of the two and the
bull was ignominiously
defeated. At a public banquet held soon after in that part of
the State, the toast-master proposed a toast to "Colonel Blank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and Schultz's bull&mdash;both opposed
to railroad trains." The
joke was widely circulated and
had much to do with completing
the discomfiture of the
opposition in the following
elections.</p>

<p>The railroad was a decided
step in advance, compared
with the stage-coach
and canal-boat, but, when we
picture the surroundings of
the traveller upon railways
during the first ten or fifteen
years of their existence,
we find his journey was not
one to be envied. He was
jammed into a narrow seat with a stiff back, the deck of the car
was low and flat, and ventilation in winter impossible. A stove at
each end did little more than generate carbonic oxide. The passenger
roasted if he sat at the end of the car, and froze if he sat
in the middle. Tallow candles furnished a "dim religious light,"
but the accompanying odor did not savor of cathedral incense.
The dust was suffocating in dry weather; there were no adequate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
spark-arresters on the engine, or screens at the windows, and the
begrimed passenger at the end of his journey looked as if he had
spent the day in a blacksmith-shop. Recent experiments in obtaining
a spectrum-analysis of the component parts of a quantity of
dust collected in a railway car show that minute particles of iron
form a large proportion, and under the microscope present the appearance
of a collection of tenpenny nails. As iron administered
to the human system through the respiratory organs in the form
of tenpenny nails mixed with other undesirable matter is not especially
recommended by medical practitioners, the sanitary surroundings
of the primitive
railway car cannot be
commended. There
were no double tracks,
and no telegraph to
facilitate the safe despatching
of trains.
The springs of the car
were hard, the jolting
intolerable, the windows
rattled like those
of the modern omnibus,
and conversation
was a luxury that
could be indulged in
only by those of recognized
superiority in
lung power. The
brakes were clumsy
and of little service.</p>

    and of little service.</p>

<p>The ends of the flat-bar
rails were cut
diagonally, so that
when laid down they
would lap and form a
smoother joint. Occasionally
they became sprung; the spikes would not hold, and
the end of the rail with its sharp point rose high enough for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
wheel to run under it, rip it loose, and send the pointed end
through the floor of the car. This was called a "snake's head,"
and the unlucky being sitting
over it was likely to be
impaled against the roof.
So that the traveller of that
day, in addition to his other
miseries, was in momentary
apprehension of being spitted
like a Christmas turkey.</p>

<p>Baggage-checks and coupon
tickets were unknown.
Long trips had to be made over lines composed of a number of short
independent railways; and at the terminus of each the bedevilled
passenger had to transfer, purchase another ticket, personally pick
out his baggage, perhaps on an uncovered platform in a rain-storm,
and take his chances of securing a seat in the train in which he
was to continue his weary journey.</p>

<p>After the principal companies had sent agents to Europe to
gather all the information possible regarding the progress made
there, they soon began to aim at perfecting what may justly be
called the American system of railways. The roadbed, or what in
England is called the "permanent way," was constructed in such a
manner as to conform to the requirements of the new country, and
the equipment was adapted to the wants of the people. In no
branch of industry has the inventive genius of the race been more
skilfully or
more successfully
employed
than in the
effort to bring
railway travel
to its present
state of perfection.
Every year has shown progress in perfecting the comforts
and safety of the railway car. In 1849 the Hodge hand-brake was
introduced, and in 1851 the Stevens brake. These enabled the cars
to be controlled in a manner which added much to the economy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
and safety of handling the trains. In 1869 George Westinghouse
patented his air-brake, by which power from the engine was transmitted
by compressed air carried through hose and acting upon the
brakes of each car in the train.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It was under the control of the
engineer, and its action was so prompt and its power so effectual
that a train could be stopped in an incredibly short time, and the
brakes released in an instant. In 1871 the vacuum-brake was devised,
by means of which the power was applied to the brakes by
exhausting the air.</p>

</div>

<p>A difficulty under which railways suffered for many years was
the method of coupling cars. The ordinary means consisted of
coupling-pins inserted into links attached to the cars. There was
a great deal of "slack," the jerking of the train in consequence was
very objectionable, and the distance between the platforms of the
cars made the crossing of them dangerous. In collisions one platform
was likely to rise above that of the adjoining car, and "telescoping"
was not an uncommon occurrence.</p>

<p>The means of warning passengers against standing on the platform
were characteristic of the dangers which threatened, and were
often ingenious in the devices for attracting attention. On a New
Jersey road there was painted on the car-door a picture of a new-made
grave, with a formidable tombstone, on which was an inscription
announcing to a terrified public that it was "Sacred to the
memory of the man who had stood on a platform."</p>

<p>The Miller coupler and buffer was patented in 1863, and obviated
many of the discomforts and dangers arising from the old
methods of coupling. This was followed by the Janney coupler<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
and a number of other devices, the essential principle of all being
an automatic arrangement by which the two knuckles of the coupler
when thrust together become securely locked, and a system of
springs which keep the buffers in close contact and prevent jerking
and jarring when the train is in motion.</p>

<p>The introduction of the bell-cord running through the train and
enabling conductors to communicate promptly by means of it with
the engineer, and signal him in case of danger, constitutes another
source of safety, but is still a wonder to Europeans, who cannot understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>why passengers do not tamper with it, and how they can
resist the temptation to give false signals by means of it. The only
answer is that our people are educated up to it, and being accustomed
to govern themselves, they do not require any restraint to make
them respect so useful a device. Aside from the inconveniences
which used to arise occasionally from a rustic mistaking the bell-cord
for a clothes-rack, and hanging his overcoat over it, or from
an old gentleman grabbing hold of it to help him climb into an
upper berth in a sleeping-car, it has been singularly exempt from
efforts to pervert it to unintended uses.</p>

<p>The application of the magnetic telegraph to railways wrought
the first great revolution in despatching trains, and introduced an
element of promptness and safety in their operation of which the most
sanguine of railroad advocates had never dreamed. The application
of electricity was gradually availed of in many ingenious signal
devices for both day and night service, to direct the locomotive engineer
in running his train, and interpose precautions against accidents.
Fusees have also been called into requisition, which burn
with a bright flame a given length of time; and when a train is behind
time and followed by another, by igniting one of these lights,
and leaving it on the track, the train following can tell by noting
the time of burning about how near it is the preceding train.
Torpedoes left upon the track, which explode when passed over by
the wheels of a following train and warn it of its proximity to a
train ahead, are also used.</p>

<p>In the early days more accidents arose from switches than from
any other cause; but improvement in their construction has progressed
until it would seem that the dangers have been effectually
overcome. The split-rail switch prevents a train from being thrown
off the track in case the switch is left open, and the result is that
in such an event the train is only turned on another track. The
Wharton switch, which leaves the main line unbroken, marks
another step in the march of improvement. Among other devices
is a complete interlocking-switch system, by means of which
one man standing in a switch-tower, overlooking a large yard with
numerous tracks, over which trains arrive and depart every few
minutes, can, by moving a system of levers, open any required
track and by the same motion block all the others, and prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the possibility of collisions or other accidents resulting from trains
entering upon the wrong track.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The steam-boats on our large rivers had been making great
progress in the comforts afforded to passengers. They were providing
berths to sleep in, serving meals in spacious cabins, and
giving musical entertainments and dancing parties on board. The
railroads soon began to learn a lesson from them in adding to the
comforts of the travelling public.</p>

<p>The first attempt to furnish the railway passenger a place to
sleep while on his journey was made upon the Cumberland Valley
Railroad of Pennsylvania, between Harrisburg and Chambersburg.
In the winter season the east-bound passengers arrived at Chambersburg
late at night by stage-coach, and as they were exhausted
by a fatiguing trip over the mountains and many wished to continue
their journey to Harrisburg to catch the morning train for
Philadelphia, it became very desirable to furnish sleeping accommodations
aboard the cars. The officers of this road fitted up a
passenger car with a number of berths, and put it into service as a
sleeping-car in the winter of 1836&ndash;37. It was exceedingly crude
and primitive in construction. It was divided by transverse partitions
into four sections, and each contained three berths&mdash;a lower,
middle, and upper berth. This car was used until 1848 and then
abandoned.</p>

<p>About this time there were also experiments made in fitting
up cars with berths something like those in a steam-boat cabin,
but these crude attempts did not prove attractive to travellers.
There were no bedclothes furnished, and only a coarse mattress
and pillow were supplied, and with the poor ventilation and the
rattling and jolting of the car there was not much comfort afforded,
except a means of resting in a position which was somewhat
more endurable than a sitting posture.</p>

<p>Previous to the year 1858 a few of the leading railways had
put on sleeping-cars which made some pretensions to meet a
growing want of the travelling public, but they were still crude,
uncomfortable, and unsatisfactory in their arrangements and appointments.</p>

<p>In the year 1858 George M. Pullman entered a train of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Lake Shore Railroad at Buffalo, to make a trip to Chicago. It
happened that a new sleeping-car which had been built for the
railroad company was attached to this train and was making its
first trip. Mr. Pullman stepped in to take a look at it, and finally
decided to test this new form of luxury by passing the night in
one of its berths. He was tossed about in a manner not very conducive
to the "folding of the hands to sleep," and he turned out
before daylight and took refuge upon a seat in the end of the car.
He now began to ponder upon the subject, and before the journey
ended he had conceived the notion that, in a country of magnificent
distances like this, a great boon could be offered to travellers
by the construction of cars easily convertible into comfortable and
convenient day or night coaches, and supplied with such appointments
as would give the occupants practically the same comforts as
were afforded by the steam-boats. He began experiments in this
direction soon after his arrival in Chicago, and in 1859 altered
some day-cars on the Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad, and converted
them into sleeping-cars which were a marked step in advance of
similar cars previously constructed. They were successful in
meeting the wants of passengers at that time, but Mr. Pullman did
not consider them in any other light than experiments. One
night, after they had made a few trips on the line between Chicago
and St. Louis, a tall, angular-looking man entered one of the cars
while Mr. Pullman was aboard, and after asking a great many intelligent
questions about the inventions, finally said he thought he
would try what the thing was like, and stowed himself away in an
upper berth. This proved to be Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_241.jpg" width="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In 1864 Mr. Pullman perfected his plans for a car which was to
be a marked and radical departure from any one ever before attempted,
and that year invested his capital in the construction of
what may be called the father of the Pullman cars. He built it in
a shed in the yard of the Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad at a cost of
$18,000, named it the "Pioneer," and designated it by the letter
"A." It did not then occur to anyone that there would ever be
enough sleeping-cars introduced to exhaust the whole twenty-six
letters of the alphabet. The sum expended upon it was naturally
looked upon as fabulous at a time when such sleeping-cars as
were used could be built for
about $4,500. The constructor
of the "Pioneer" aimed to produce
a car which would prove
acceptable in every respect to
the travelling public. It had
improved trucks and a raised
deck, and was built a foot wider
and two and a half feet higher
than any car then in service.
He deemed this necessary for
the purpose of introducing a
hinged upper berth, which, when
fastened up, formed a recess behind
it for stowing the necessary
bedding in the daytime. Before
that the mattresses had been
piled in one end of the car, and
had to be dragged through the
aisle when wanted. It was
known to him that the dimensions
of the bridges and station-platforms would not admit of its
passing over the line, but he was singularly confident in the belief
that an attractive car, constructed upon correct principles, would find
its way into service against all obstacles. It so happened that soon
after the car was finished, in the spring of 1865, the body of President
Lincoln arrived at Chicago, and the "Pioneer" was wanted
for the funeral train which was to take it to Springfield. To enable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the car to pass over the road, the station-platforms and other
obstructions were reduced in size, and thereafter the line was in a
condition to put the car into service. A few months afterward
General Grant was making a trip West to visit his home in Galena,
Ill., and as the railway companies were anxious to take him from
Detroit to his destination in the car which had now become quite
celebrated, the station-platforms along the line were widened for
the purpose, and thus another route was opened to its passage.</p>

<p>The car was now put into regular service on the Alton road.
Its popularity fully realized the anticipations of its owner, and its
size became the standard for the future Pullman cars as to height
and width, though they have since been increased in length.</p>

<p>The railroad company entered into an agreement to have this
car, and a number of others which were immediately built, operated
upon its lines. They were marvels of beauty, and their construction
embraced patents of such ingenuity and originality that
they attracted marked attention in the railroad world and created
a new departure in the method of travel.</p>

<p>In 1867 Mr. Pullman formed the Pullman Car Company and
devoted it to carrying out an idea which he had conceived, of organizing
a system by which passengers could be carried in luxurious
cars of uniform pattern, adequate to the wants of both night
and day travel, which would run through without change between
far-distant points and over a number of distinct lines of railway, in
charge of responsible through agents, to whom ladies, children,
and invalids could be safely intrusted. This system was especially
adapted to a country of such geographical extent as America. It
supplied an important want, and the travelling public and the railways
were prompt to avail themselves of its advantages.</p>

<p>Parlor or drawing-room cars were next introduced for day runs,
which added greatly to the luxury of travel, enabling passengers
to secure seats in advance, and enjoy many comforts which were
not found in ordinary cars. Sleeping and parlor cars were soon
recognized as an essential part of a railway's equipment and became
known as "palace cars."</p>

<p>The Wagner Car Company was organized in the State of New
York, and was early in the field in furnishing this class of vehicles.
It has supplied all the cars of this kind used upon the Vanderbilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
system of railways and a number of its connecting roads. Several
smaller palace-car companies have also engaged in the business at
different times. A few roads have operated their own cars of this
class, but the business is generally regarded as a specialty, and the
railway companies recognize the advantages and conveniences resulting
from the ability of a large car-company to meet the irregularities
of travel, which require a large equipment at one season and
a small one at another, to furnish an additional supply of cars for a
sudden demand, and to perform satisfactorily the business of operating
through cars in lines composed of many different railways.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">Pullman Parlor Car.</div>
</div>

<p>Next came a demand for cars in which meals could be served.
Why, it was said, should a train stop at a station for meals any
more than a steam-boat tie up to a wharf for the same purpose?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
The Pullman Company now introduced the hotel-car, which
was practically a sleeping-car with a kitchen and pantries in one end
and portable tables which could be placed between the seats of
each section and upon which meals could be conveniently served.
The first hotel-car was named the "President," and was put into
service on the Great Western Railway of Canada, in 1867, and soon
after several popular lines were equipped with this new addition to
the luxuries of travel.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_244.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Wagner Parlor Car.</div>
</div>

<p>After this came the dining-car, which was still another step beyond
the hotel-car. It was a complete restaurant, having a large
kitchen and pantries in one end, with the main body of the car
fitted up as a commodious dining-room, in which all the passengers
in the train could enter and take their meals comfortably. The
first dining-car was named the "Delmonico," and began running
on the Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad in the year 1868.</p>

<p>The comforts and conveniences of travel by rail on the main
lines now seemed to have reached their culmination in America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
The heavy <span class="bold fs120">T</span>-rails had replaced the various forms previously used;
the improved fastenings, the reductions in curvature, and the greater
care exercised in construction had made the trip delightfully
smooth, while the improvements in rolling-stock had obviated the
jerking, jolting, and oscillation of the cars. The roadbeds had
been properly ditched, drained, and ballasted with broken stone
or gravel, the dust overcome, the sparks arrested, and cleanliness,
that attribute which stands next to godliness, had at last been
made possible, even on a railway train.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_245.jpg" width="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Dining-car (Chicago, Burlington, &amp; Quincy Railroad.)</div>
</div>

<p>The heating of cars was not successfully accomplished till a
method was devised for circulating hot water through pipes running
near the floor. The suffering from that bane of the traveller&mdash;cold
feet&mdash;was then obviated and many a doctor's bill saved.
The loss of human life from the destruction of trains by fires originating
from stoves aroused such a feeling throughout the country
that the legislatures of many States have passed laws within the
last three years prohibiting the use of stoves, and the railway managers
have been devising plans for heating the trains with steam
furnished from the boiler of the locomotive. The inventive genius
of the people was at once brought into requisition, and several
ingenious devices are now in use which successfully accomplish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the purpose in solid trains with the locomotive attached, but the
problem of heating a detached car without some form of furnace
connected with it is still unsolved.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the high standard of excellence which
had been reached in the construction and operation of passenger
trains, there was one want not yet supplied, the importance of
which did not become fully recognized until dining-cars were introduced,
and men, women, and children had to pass across the
platforms of several cars in order to reach the one in which the
meals were served. An act which passengers had always been
cautioned against, and forbidden to undertake&mdash;the crossing of
platforms while the train is in motion&mdash;now became necessary,
and was invited by the railway companies.</p>

<p>It was soon seen that a safe covered passageway between the
cars must be provided, particularly for limited express trains.
Crude attempts had been made in this direction at different times.
As early as the years 1852 and 1855 patents were taken out for
devices which provided for diaphragms of canvas to connect adjoining
cars and form a passageway between them. These were applied
to cars on the Naugatuck Railroad, in Connecticut, in 1857,
but they were used mainly for purposes of ventilation, to provide
for taking in air at the head of the train, so as to permit the car
windows to be kept shut, to avoid the dust that entered through
them when they were open. These appliances were very imperfect,
did not seem to be of any practical advantage, even for the
limited uses for which they were intended, and they were abandoned
after a trial of about four years.</p>

<p>In the year 1886 Mr. Pullman went practically to work to devise
a perfect system for constructing continuous trains, and at the
same time to provide for sufficient flexibility in connecting the
passageways to allow for the motion consequent upon the rounding
of curves. His efforts resulted in what is now known as the
"vestibuled" train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span><br />
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_249.jpg" width="350" alt="" />
<div class="caption">End View of a Vestibuled Car.</div>
</div>

<p>This invention, which was patented in 1887, succeeded not only
in supplying the means of constructing a perfectly enclosed vestibule
of handsome architectural appearance between the cars, but it accomplished
what is even still more important, the introduction of a
safety appliance more valuable than any yet devised for the protection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of human life in case of collisions. The elastic diaphragms
which are attached to the ends of the cars have steel frames, the
faces or bearing surfaces
of which are pressed firmly
against each other by
powerful spiral springs,
which create a friction
upon the faces of the
frames, hold them firmly
in position, prevent the
oscillation of the cars, and
furnish a buffer extending
from the platform to the
roof which precludes the
possibility of one platform
"riding" the other and
producing telescoping in
case of collision. The
first of the vestibuled
trains went into service
on the Pennsylvania Railroad in June, 1886, and they are rapidly
being adopted by railway companies. The vestibuled limited trains
contain several sleeping-cars, a dining-car, and a car fitted up with a
smoking saloon, a library with books, desks, and writing materials,
a bath-room, and a barber-shop. With a free circulation of air
throughout the train, the cars opening into each other, the electric
light, the many other increased comforts and conveniences introduced,
the steam-heating apparatus avoiding the necessity of using
fires, the great speed, and absence of stops at meal-stations, this
train is the acme of safe and luxurious travel. An ordinary passenger
travels in as princely a style in these cars as any crowned
head in Europe in a royal special train.</p>

<p>The speed of passenger trains has shown steady improvement
from year to year. In the month of June in our Centennial year,
1876, a train ran from New York to San Francisco, a distance of
3,317 miles, in 83 hours and 27 minutes actual time, thus averaging
about 40 miles an hour, but during the trip it crossed four
mountain-summits, one of them over 8,000 feet high. This train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
ran from Jersey City to Pittsburg over the Pennsylvania Railroad,
a distance of 444 miles, without making a stop. In 1882 locomotives
were introduced which made a speed of 70 miles per hour.</p>

<div class="caption">Pullman Sleeper on a Vestibuled Train.</div>

<p>In July, 1885, an engine with a train of three cars made a trip
over the West Shore road which is the most extraordinary one
on record. It started from East Buffalo, N. Y., at 10.04 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>,
and reached Weehawken, N. J., at 7.27 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> Deducting the
time consumed in stops, the actual running time was 7 hours and
23 minutes, or an average of 56 miles per hour. Between Churchville
and Genesee Junction this train attained the unparalleled
speed of 87 miles per hour, and at several other parts of the line
a speed of from 70 to 80 miles an hour. The superior physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
characteristics of this road were particularly favorable for the attainment
of the speed mentioned.</p>

<p>The trains referred to were special or experimental trains, and
while American railways have shown their ability to record the
highest speed yet known, they do not run their trains in regular
service as fast as those on the English railways. The meteor-like
names given to our fast trains are somewhat misleading.
When one reads of such trains as the "Lightning," the "Cannonball,"
the "Thunderbolt," and the "G&mdash;whiz-z," the suggestiveness
of the titles is enough to make one's head swim, but, after all,
the names are not as significant of speed as the British "Flying
Scotchman" and the "Wild Irishman;" for the former do not
attain an average rate of 40 miles an hour, while the latter exceed
45 miles. A few American trains, however, those between Jersey
City and Philadelphia, for instance, make an average speed of over
50 miles per hour.</p>

<p>The manufacture of railway passenger cars is a large item of
industry in the country. The tendency had been for many years
to confine the building of ordinary passenger coaches to the shops
owned by the railway companies, and they made extensive provision
for such work; but recently they have given large orders for
that class of equipment to outside manufacturers. This has resulted

of the excellence of the work supplied by some of the manufacturing
companies. In 1880 the Pullman Company erected the
most extensive car-works in the world at Pullman, fourteen miles
south of Chicago; and, besides its extensive output of Pullman
cars and freight equipment, it has built for railway companies large
numbers of passenger coaches. The employees now number
about 5,000, and an idea of the capacity and resources of the shops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
may be obtained from the fact that one hundred freight cars, of
the kind known as flat cars, have been built in eight hours. The
business of car-building has therefore given rise to the first model
manufacturing town in America, and it is an industry evidently
destined to increase as rapidly as any in the country.</p>

    <p>The manufacture of railway passenger cars is a large item of
    industry in the country. The tendency had been for many years
    to confine the building of ordinary passenger coaches to the shops
    owned by the railway companies, and they made extensive provision
    for such work; but recently they have given large orders for
    that class of equipment to outside manufacturers. This has resulted
    partly from the large demand for cars, and partly on account
    of the excellence of the work supplied by some of the manufacturing
    companies. In 1880 the Pullman Company erected the
    most extensive car-works in the world at Pullman, fourteen miles
    south of Chicago; and, besides its extensive output of Pullman
    cars and freight equipment, it has built for railway companies large
    numbers of passenger coaches. The employees now number
    about 5,000, and an idea of the capacity and resources of the shops
    may be obtained from the fact that one hundred freight cars, of
    the kind known as flat cars, have been built in eight hours. The
    business of car-building has therefore given rise to the first model
    manufacturing town in America, and it is an industry evidently
    destined to increase as rapidly as any in the country.</p>

<p>The transportation of baggage has always been a most important
item to the traveller, and the amount carried seems to increase
in proportion to the advance in civilization. The original allowance
of fourteen pounds is found to be increased to four hundred
when ladies start for fashionable summer-resorts.</p>

<p>America has been much more liberal than other countries to
the traveller in this particular, as in all others. Here few of the
roads charge for excess of baggage unless the amount be so large
that patience with regard to it ceases to be a virtue.</p>

<p>The earlier method, of allowing each passenger to pick out his
own baggage at his point of destination and carry it off, resulted
in a lack of accountability which led to much confusion, frequent
losses, and heavy claims upon the companies in consequence.
Necessity, as usual, gave birth to invention, and the difficulty was
at last solved by the introduction of the system known as "checking."
A metal disk bearing a number and designating on its face
the destination of the baggage was attached to each article and a
duplicate given to the owner, which answered as a receipt, and
upon the presentation and surrender of which the baggage could
be claimed. Railways soon united in arranging for through checks
which, when attached to baggage, would insure its being sent safely
to distant points over lines composed of many connecting roads.
The check system led to the introduction of another marked convenience
in the handling of baggage&mdash;the baggage express or
transfer company. One of its agents will now check trunks at the
passenger's own house and haul them to the train. Another
agent will take up the checks aboard the train as it is nearing its
destination, and see that the baggage is delivered at any given
address.</p>

<p>The cases in which pieces go astray are astonishingly rare, and
some roads found the claims for lost articles reduced by five thousand
dollars the first year after adopting the check system, not to
mention the amount saved in the reduced force of employees en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>gaged
in assorting and handling the baggage. Its workings are
so perfect and its conveniences so great that an American cannot
easily understand why it is not adopted in all countries; but he is
forced to recognize the fact that it seems destined to be confined
to his own land. The London railway managers, for instance,
give many reasons for turning their faces against its adoption.
They say that there are few losses arising from passengers taking
baggage that does not belong to them; that most of the passengers
take a cab at the end of their railway journey to reach
their homes, and it costs but little more to carry their trunk with
them; that in this way it gets home as soon as they, while the
transfer company, or baggage express, would not deliver it for an
hour or two later; that the cab system is a great convenience, and
any change which would diminish its patronage would gradually
reduce the number of cabs, and these "gondolas of London"
would have to increase their charges or go out of business. It is
very easy to find a stick when one wants to hit a dog, and the
European railway officials seem never to be at a loss for reasons
in rejecting the check system.</p>

<p>Coupon tickets covering trips over several different railways
have saved the traveller all the annoyance once experienced in
purchasing separate tickets from the several companies representing
the roads over which he had to pass. Their introduction necessitated
an agreement among the principal railways of the country
and the adoption of an extensive system of accountability for
the purpose of making settlements of the amounts represented by
the coupons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span><br />

<div class="caption">In a Baggage-room.</div>
</div>

<p>Like every other novelty the coupon ticket, when first introduced,
did not hit the mark when aimed at the understanding of
certain travellers. A United States Senator-elect had come on by
sea from the Pacific Coast who had never seen a railroad till he
reached the Atlantic seaboard. With a curiosity to test the workings
of the new means of transportation, of which he had heard so
much, he bought a coupon ticket and set out for a railway journey.
He entered a car, took a seat next to the door, and was just beginning
to get the "hang of the school-house" when the conductor,
who was then not uniformed, came in, cried "Tickets!" and reached
out his hand toward the Senator. "What do you want of me?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
said the latter. "I want your ticket," answered the conductor.
Now it occurred to the Senator that this might be a very neat job
on the part of an Eastern ticket-sharp, but it was just a little too
thin to fool a Pacific Coaster, and he said: "Don't you think I've
got sense enough to know that if I parted with my ticket right at
the start I wouldn't have anything to show for my money during
the rest of the way? No, sir, I'm going to hold on to this till I
get to the end of the trip."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the conductor, whose impatience was now rising
to fever heat, "I don't want to take up your ticket, I only want to
look at it."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_257.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Railway Station at York, England, built on a curve.</div>
</div>

<p>The Senator thought, after some reflection, that he would risk
letting the man have a peep at it, anyhow, and held it up before
him, keeping it, however, at a safe distance. The conductor, with
the customary abruptness, jerked it out of his hand, tore off the
first coupon, and was about to return the ticket, when the Pacific
Coaster sprang up, threw himself upon his muscle, and delivered a
well-directed blow of his fist upon the conductor's right eye, which
landed him sprawling on one of the opposite seats. The other
passengers were at once on their feet, and rushed up to know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
cause of the disturbance. The Senator, still standing with his
arms in a pugnacious attitude, said:</p>

<p>"Maybe I've never ridden on a railroad before, but I'm not
going to let any sharper get away with me like that."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_258.jpg" width="575" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Outside the Grand Central Station, New York.</div>
</div>

<p>"What's he done?" cried the passengers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why," said the Senator, "I paid seventeen dollars and a half
for a ticket to take me through to Cincinnati, and before we're five
miles out that fellow slips up and says he wants to see it, and when
I get it out, he grabs hold of it and goes to tearing it up right before
my eyes." Ample explanations were soon made, and the new
passenger was duly initiated into the mysteries of the coupon system.</p>

<p>The uniforming of railway employees was a movement of no
little importance. It designated the various positions held by
them, added much to the neatness of their appearance, enabled
passengers to recognize them at a glance, and made them so conspicuous
that it impressed them with a greater sense of responsibility
and aided much in effecting a more
courteous demeanor to passengers.</p>

<p>Railway accidents have always been a great source of anxiety
to the managers, and the shocks received by the public when
great loss of life occurs from such causes deepen the interest
which the general community feels in the means taken to avoid
these distressing occurrences.</p>

<p>American railway officials have made encouraging progress in
reducing the number and the severity of accidents, and while the
record is not so good on many of our cheaply constructed roads,
our first-class roads now show by their statistics that they compare
favorably in this respect with the European companies.</p>

<p>The statistics regarding accidents<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> are necessarily unreliable,
as railway companies are not eager to publish their calamities from
the house-tops, and only in those States in which prompt reports
are required to be made by law are the figures given at all accurately.
Even in these instances the yearly reports lead to wrong
conclusions, for the State Railroad Commissioners become more
exacting each year as to the thoroughness of the reports called
for, and the results sometimes show an increase compared with previous
years, whereas there may have been an actual decrease.</p>

<p>In 1880, the last census year, an effort was made to collect statistics
of this kind covering all the railways in the United States,
with the following result:</p>

<p>That the figures given above are much too high as regards the
United States, there can be no doubt. For the fiscal year 1880&ndash;81
the data compiled by the Railroad Commissioners of Massachusetts
and published in their reports give as the total number of persons
killed and injured in the United States 2,126, as against 8,216
upon which the comparisons in the above table are based. If we
substitute in this table the former number for the latter, it would
reduce the number of injured per million passengers in the
United States to 10.6, about the same as on the European railways.</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>From this it will be seen that in the United Kingdom the average
distance a passenger may travel before being killed is about
equal to twice the distance of the Earth from the Sun. In New York
he may travel a distance greater than that of Mars from the Sun;
and in Massachusetts he can comfort himself with the thought
that he may travel twenty-seven millions of miles farther than
the distance of Jupiter to the Sun before suffering death on the
rail.</p>

<p>The most encouraging feature of these statistics is the fact that
the number of railway accidents per mile in the United States has
shown a marked decrease each year. Taking the figures adopted
by the Massachusetts commissions, the number of persons injured
in the year 1880&ndash;81 was 2,126, and in 1886&ndash;87, 2,483, while in
the same time the number of miles in operation increased from
93,349 to 137,986.</p>

<p>The amounts paid annually by railways in satisfaction of claims
for damages to passengers are serious items of expenditure, and in
the United States have reached in some years nearly two millions
of dollars. About half of the States limit the amount of damages
in case of death to $5,000, the States of Virginia, Ohio, and Kansas
to $10,000, and the remainder have no statutory limit.</p>

<p>In the year 1840 the number of miles of railway per 100,000 inhabitants
in the different countries named was as follows: United
States, 20; United Kingdom, 3; Europe, 1; in the year 1882,
United States, 210; United Kingdom, 52; Europe, 34.</p>

<p>In the year 1886 the total number of miles in the United
States was 137,986; the number of passengers carried, 382,284,972;
the number carried one mile, 9,659,698,294; the average distance
travelled per passenger, 25.27 miles.</p>

<p>In Europe the first-class travel is exceedingly small and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
third class constitutes the largest portion of the passenger business,
while in America almost the whole of the travel is first class,
as will be seen from the following table:</p>

<p>The third-class travel in this country is better known as immigrant
travel. The percentages given in the above table for the
United States are based upon an average of the numbers of passengers
of each class carried on the principal through lines. If
all the roads were included, the percentages of the second- and
third-class travel would be still less.</p>

<p>That which is of more material interest to passengers than anything
else is the rate of fare charged.</p>

<p>The following table gives an approximate comparison between
the rates per mile in the leading countries in the world:</p>

<p>The rates above given for the United Kingdom, France, and
Germany are the regular schedule-rates. An average of all the
fares received, including the reduced fares at excursion rates, would
make the figures somewhat less.</p>

<p>The rate named as the first-class fare for the railways in the
United States is, strictly speaking, the average earnings per passenger
per mile, and includes all classes; but as the first-class
passengers constitute about ninety-nine per centum of the travel
the amount does not differ materially from the actual first-class fare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
In the State of New York the first-class fare does not exceed two
cents, which is not much more than the third-class fare in some
countries of Europe, and heat, good ventilation, ice-water, toilet
arrangements, and free carriage of a liberal amount of baggage
are supplied, while in Europe few of these comforts are furnished.</p>

<p>On the elevated railroads of New York a passenger can ride
in a first-class car eleven miles for 5 cents, or about one-half cent a
mile, and on surface-roads the commutation rates given to suburban
passengers are in some cases still less.</p>

<p>The berth-fares in sleeping-cars in Europe largely exceed those
in America, as will be seen from the following comparisons, stated
in dollars:</p>

<p>While it would seem that the luxuries of railway travel in America
have reached a maximum, and the charges a minimum, yet in
this progressive age it is very probable that in the not far distant
future we shall witness improvements over the present
methods which will astonish us as much as the present methods
surprise us when we compare them with those of the past.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE WANDERINGS OF A CAR.</span></h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_267.jpg" width="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capx">On the 14th of December, 1886, there was
loaded in Indianapolis a car belonging to
one of the roads passing through that city. It
was loaded with corn consigned to parties in
Boston. The car was delivered to the Lake
Shore road at Cleveland on the 16th; but, owing
to bad weather and various other local causes, it
did not reach East Buffalo until December 28th.
It was turned over by the New York Central &amp;
Hudson River Railroad to the West Shore road the next day, and
by this company was taken to Rotterdam Junction, and there delivered
on December 31st to the Western Division of the Fitchburg
Railroad, or what was then known as the Boston, Hoosac
Tunnel &amp; Western. They took it promptly through to Boston.
After a few days the corn was sold by the consignees for delivery
in Medfield, on the New York &amp; New England Railway. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
car was delivered to this road on January 24, 1887, and taken
down to Medfield. There it remained among a large number of
other cars, until it suited the convenience of the purchaser to put
the corn into his elevator.</p>

<p>On the 17th of March the car was unloaded, taken back to
Boston, and delivered to the Fitchburg road to be sent West,
homeward. That company took it promptly, but instead of delivering
it to the West Shore road at Rotterdam Junction, as would
have been the regular course, either through some mistake of a
yardmaster at the junction station, or in pursuance of general instructions
to load all Western cars home whenever practicable, the
car was not delivered to the West Shore, but was turned over to
the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Co's. Railroad, taken down to
the coal regions, and on March 31st delivered to the Delaware,
Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad, by whom it was loaded with coal
for Chicago. That company promptly delivered it to the Grand
Trunk at Buffalo, and on April 10th the car reached Chicago. It
was immediately reconsigned by the local agents of the coal company
to a dealer in the town of Minot, 523 miles west of St. Paul,
on the St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Manitoba Railroad. To reach that
point, it was delivered to the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific on
April 10th, then to the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Northern,
Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis, St. Paul &amp; Duluth, St. Paul, Minneapolis
&amp; Manitoba, arriving at its destination on the 14th of April.</p>

<p>Winter still reigned in that locality, and the car was promptly
unloaded, and returned to St. Paul, where it was loaded with wheat
consigned to New York. It left St. Paul on the 26th of April, was
promptly moved through to Chicago, and delivered to the Grand
Trunk. Coming east, in Canada, the train of which this car
formed a part, while passing through a small station, in the night
ran into an open switch. The engine dashed into a number of
loaded cars standing on the siding, and the cars behind it were
piled up in bad confusion, a number of them being destroyed, and
the freight scattered in all directions. Our car, whose history we
are tracing, suffered comparatively slight damage. The drawheads
were broken, and some castings on one truck, not sufficient
to affect in any way the loading of the car. It was sent to the
shops of the road; and it became necessary for them, on examina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>tion,
to send to the owners of the car for a casting to replace that
broken on the truck. This resulted in serious detention. The
requisition for this casting had to be approved by the Superintendent
and by the General Manager, and was forwarded, after a considerable
delay, to the officers of the road owning the car. There
it was sent through a number of offices before it finally reached the
hands of the man who was able to supply the required casting.
This in turn was sent by freight, and passed over the intervening
territory at a slow rate; the whole involving a detention which
held the car from April 28th, when it was delivered at Chicago to
the Grand Trunk, until July 18th, when finally the Grand Trunk
delivered it to the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western at Buffalo.
It came through promptly to New York, the grain was put in an
elevator, the car was sent back once more to the mines at Scranton,
and again loaded with coal for Chicago. On August 9th the
record says the car was delivered by the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp;
Western to the Grand Trunk, and on the 12th of August it was in
Chicago.</p>

<p>About this time the owners of the car began to make vigorous
appeals to the various roads, urging them to send the car home.
One of these tracers reached the Grand Trunk road while they
still held the car in their possession; so that orders were sent that
the coal must be unloaded at once, and the car returned. In order
to unload it, it was necessary to switch it to the Illinois Central for
some local consignee, and it was unloaded within four days and
delivered back to the Grand Trunk at Chicago. This was on
August 16th. During the few days that had elapsed since the
order was given to send this car home, there had been an active
demand for cars, and knowing that this one had to be sent to Buffalo
in order to be delivered to the Lake Shore road, from which it
had originally been received, the car was loaded for that point.
This again resulted in detention, for we find that the car was held
on the Grand Trunk tracks at Black Rock, awaiting the pleasure of
the consignee to unload the freight, until the 27th of September;
and then, instead of being unloaded and delivered to the Lake
Shore road, as had been the intention of the Grand Trunk officials,
the consignee sold the wheat in the car to a local dealer on the
line of the Erie Railway, and the car was sent down on that road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
on October 1st, and not returned to the Grand Trunk again until
the 10th day of October.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Erie was as anxious at that time to load cars
west with coal as the other roads, and when they brought the car
back to the Grand Trunk, they brought it once more filled with
coal, and back the car went to Chicago, reaching there on the 13th
of October.</p>

<p>It had now been away from home and diverted from its legitimate
uses for nine months, and apparently was as far from home
as ever. The delivery of the coal this time at Chicago put the car
in the hands of the Louisville, New Albany &amp; Chicago Railway,
and they promptly gave it a lading by the southern route to Newport
News; for we find the car delivered by the Louisville, New
Albany &amp; Chicago to the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio route on October
28th, and at Newport News on the 10th of November. The
owners of the car were meanwhile not idle. The occasional stray
junction cards which came in notified them of the passage of the car
by different junction points, giving them clews to work by, and
they were in vigorous correspondence with the various roads over
which the car had gone, urging, begging, and imploring the railway
officers to make all efforts in their power to get the car back
to its home road.</p>

<p>On its last trip from Chicago to Newport News, the car passed
through Indianapolis, the very point from which it began its long
journey and many wanderings. Unfortunately, however, it passed
there loaded, without detention, and the owners of the car did not
discover until it had been for some time at Newport News, that
the car had been anywhere near its home territory. By the time
they made this discovery the car had been unloaded, and had
started west once more. The records of the movement of the car
here become dim. It was apparently diverted from its direct route
back, which would have taken it once more to Indianapolis, and so
home, for we find, after waiting at Newport News for some time
to be unloaded, it was delivered to the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp;
St. Louis, next on the Western &amp; Atlantic, and so down into
Georgia and South Carolina. Again, on January 14, 1888, the
car was reported on the Richmond &amp; Danville. They sent it
once more down into South Carolina and Georgia. From there it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
was loaded down to Selma, Ala., on the Atlanta &amp; West Point
Railroad. They returned it promptly to Atlanta, and so to the
Central Railroad of Georgia; and the car, after being used backward
and forward between Montgomery and Atlanta and Macon,
finally appeared at Augusta, Ga., where it stood on February 11,
1888. Here the car remained for some time, long enough for the
owners to get advices as to its whereabouts, and communicate with
the road on whose territory the car was, before it was again
moved. An urgent representation of the case having been laid
before the proper authorities, they agreed, if possible, to load it in
such a way that it should go back to Indianapolis. This could not
be done at once, however; but about the 12th of March the car was
sent to a near-by point in South Carolina loaded, and worked back
over the Georgia road and the Western Atlantic, delivered to the
Louisville &amp; Nashville on April 3d, and finally, after its many and
long wanderings, was by that road delivered to the home road at
Cincinnati on the 17th of April; having been away from home
sixteen months and one day.</p>

<p>This is a case taken from actual records, and is one that could
be duplicated probably by any railroad in the country.</p>

<p>This is but an example of a correspondence that is constantly
being exchanged between the officials who are in charge of the
Transportation Department of the various railways of the country.</p>

<p>The demands of trade necessitate continually the transportation
of all manner of commodities over great distances.</p>

<p>Thus, wheat is brought from the Northwest to the seaboard,
corn from the Southwest, cotton from the South, fruit comes from
California, black walnut from Indiana, and pine from Michigan.
In the opposite direction, merchandise and manufactured articles
are sent from the East to all points in the West, the North, and
Southwest. The interchange is constant and steadily increasing
in all directions.</p>

<p>In the early period of railways in this country, when they were
built chiefly to promote local interests, and the movement of either
freight or passengers over long distances was a comparatively
small portion of the traffic, it was customary for all roads to do
their business in their own cars, transferring any freight destined
to a station on a connecting road at the junction or point of interchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of the two roads. While this system had the advantage
of keeping at home the equipment of each road, it resulted in a
very slow movement of the freight. As the volume of traffic grew,
and the interchange of commodities between distant points increased,
this slow movement became more and more vexatious.
Soon the railway companies found it necessary to allow their cars
to run through to the destination of the freight without transfer, or
they would be deprived of the business by more enterprising rivals.
So that to-day a very large proportion of the freight business of
the country is done without transfer; the same car taking the load
from the initial point direct to destination. The result of this is,
however, that a considerable share of all the business of any railway
is done in cars belonging to other companies, for which mileage
has to be paid; while, in turn, the cars of any one company
may be scattered all over the country from Maine to California,
Winnipeg to Mexico.</p>

<p>The problem that constantly confronts the general superintendent
of a railway is, how to improve the time of through freight,
thereby improving the service and increasing the earnings of the
company; and, at the same time, how to secure the prompt movement
of cars belonging to the company, getting them home from
other roads, and reducing as far as possible upon his own line the
use of foreign cars, and the consequent payment of mileage therefor.</p>

<p>By common consent the mileage for the use of all eight-wheel
freight cars has been fixed at three-quarters of a cent per mile run;
four-wheel cars being rated at one-half this amount, or three-eighths
of a cent. This amount would at first sight appear to be
insignificant, yet in the aggregate it comes to a very considerable
sum. In the case of some of the more important roads in the
country, even those possessing a large equipment, the balance
against them for mileage alone often amounts to nearly half a million
annually.</p>

<p>It becomes therefore of the first importance to reduce to a
minimum the use of foreign cars, thereby reducing the mileage
balance; at the same time avoiding any action that will interfere
with or impede in any way the prompt movement of traffic.</p>

<p>The first step toward accomplishing this result is to organize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
and fully equip the Car Accountant's Department. The importance
of this office has been recognized only of late years. Formerly,
and on many lines even now, the Car Accountant was merely
a subordinate in the Auditing Department of the company. His
duties were confined strictly to computing the mileage due to other
roads. This he did from the reports of the freight-train conductors,
often in a cumbrous and mechanical manner, making no allowance
for possible errors. At the same time, he received reports of
foreign roads without question and without check. He was not
interested in any way in the operations of the Transportation
Department; and, as a consequence, it never occurred to him to
make inquiries as to the proper use of the cars belonging to his
own company. That he left entirely to the Superintendent. The
latter, on the other hand, his time incessantly filled with many
duties, could give but scant attention to his cars.</p>

<p>The Superintendent of a railway in this country who has, let
us say, three hundred miles of road in his charge, has perhaps as
great a variety of occupation, and as many different questions of
importance depending upon his decision, as any other business or
professional man in the community. Fully one-half of his time
will be spent out-of-doors looking after the physical condition of
his track, masonry, bridges, stations, buildings of all kinds. Concerning
the repair or renewal of each he will have to pass judgment.
He must know intimately every foot of his track and, in
cases of emergency or accident, know just what resources he can
depend upon, and how to make them most immediately useful.
He will visit the shops and round houses frequently, and will know
the construction and daily condition of every locomotive, every
passenger and baggage car. He will consult with his Master
Mechanic, and often will decide which car or engine shall and
which shall not be taken in for repair, etc. He has to plan and
organize the work of every yard, every station. He must know
the duties of each employee on his pay-rolls, and instruct all new
men, or see that they are properly instructed. He must keep incessant
and vigilant watch on the movement of all trains, noting the
slightest variation from the schedules which he has prepared, and
looking carefully into the causes therefor, so as to avoid its recurrence.
The first thing in the morning he is greeted with a report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
giving the situation of business on the road, the events of the
night, movement of trains, and location and volume of freight to
be handled. The last thing at night he gets a final report of the
location and movement of important trains; and he never closes
his eyes without thinking that perhaps the telephone will ring and
call him before dawn. During the day in his office he has reports
to make out, requisitions to approve, a varied correspondence, not
always agreeable, to answer. Added to this, frequent consultations
with the officers of the Traffic Department, or with those of
connecting lines, in reference to the movement of through or local
business, completely fill his time.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at that such a man gives but slight attention
in many cases to the matter of car mileage. He frequently
satisfies himself by arranging a system of reports from his agents
to his office that give a summary each twenty-four hours of the
cars of every kind on hand at each station; and leaves the distribution
and movement of the cars in the hands of his agents. He
will give some attention to the matter whenever he goes over his
road on other and more pressing duties. Occasionally he will
even take a day or two and visit every station, inquiring carefully
as to each car he finds; why it is being held, for what purpose,
and how long it has stood. Then, satisfied with having, as he
says, "shaken up the boys," he will turn his attention to other
matters, and let the cars take care of themselves. When the
monthly or quarterly statements are made up, and he sees the
amount of balance against his road for car mileage, he gives it but
little thought, regarding it as one of the items like taxes, important,
of course, but hardly one for which he is responsible.</p>

<p>His General Manager, however, will note the car-mileage balance
with more concern; and, looking into the matter carefully, he
will discover that the remedy is to put the Car Accountant into
the Transportation Department; thus at once interesting him in
the economical use of the equipment, and also placing in the hands
of the Superintendent the machinery he needs to enable him to
promptly control and direct the use of all cars.</p>

<p>The Car Accountant's Office may properly be divided into two
main branches&mdash;mileage and record. The computation of mileage
is made in most cases directly from the reports of each train.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
These reports are made by the train conductors, and give the initials
and number of each car in their train, whether loaded or
empty, and the station whence taken and where left. To facilitate
the computation of mileage of each car, the stations on the road
are consecutively numbered, beginning at nought&mdash;each succeeding
station being represented by a number equivalent to the
number of miles it is distant from the initial station; excepting divisional
and terminal stations, where letters are used, to reduce the
work in recording. The conductors report the stations between
which each car moves by their numbers or letters. So that all
that is necessary for the mileage clerk to do is to take the difference
between the station numbers in each case, and he has the miles
travelled by that car. The mileage of each car having been so
noted on the conductor's report, it is then condensed, the mileage
of all cars of any given road or line being added together, and
the results entered into the ledgers. At the close of the month
these books are footed, and a report is rendered to each road in
the country of the mileage and amount in money due therefor, in
each case; and settlements are made accordingly, either in full or
by balance. This is purely the accounting side of the Car Accountant's
Office.</p>

<p>There remains the record branch, equally important, and to
the operating department far more interesting. This consists
broadly in a complete record being kept of the daily movement
and location of every car upon the road, local or foreign. At
first sight this may seem to be a difficult and complicated operation,
but, in fact, it is simple. The record is first divided between
local and foreign; local cars being all cars owned by the home
road, foreign being all those owned by other roads. The local
books are of large size, ruled in such a way as to allow space for
the daily movement or location of each car for one month, and
admit of twenty-five or fifty cars being recorded upon each page.
The record books for foreign cars are similarly ruled, a slight
change being necessary to allow for the numbers and initials of the
foreign cars, which cannot well be arranged for in advance.</p>

<p>The train conductors' reports are placed in the hands of the
record clerks, each one recording the movements of certain initials,
or series of numbers, under the date as shown by the report; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
reports being handed from one to another until every car has been
entered and the report checked.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_277.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A Page from the Car Accountant's Book.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></div>
</div>

<p>In addition to the conductors' train reports, the Car Accountant
receives reports from all junction stations daily, showing all
cars received from or delivered to connecting roads, whether
loaded or empty, and the destination of each. He also has reports
from all stations showing cars received and forwarded, from midnight
to midnight, cars remaining on hand loaded or empty; and
if loaded, contents and consignee, and also cars in process of loading
or unloading, and reports from shops or yards showing cars
undergoing repairs, or waiting for the same. In fine, he endeavors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
to get complete reports showing every car that either may be
in motion or standing at any point on his road. All of these are
entered on his record books. The station reports check those of
the conductor, and <em>vice versa</em>. It will thus be seen that the record
gives a complete history of the movement and daily use of
each car on the road.</p>

<p>In case of stock and perishable freight, or freight concerning
whose movements quick time is of the utmost importance, this
record is kept not only by days but by hours; that is, the actual
time of each movement is entered on the record. This is done by
a simple system of signs, so that an exact account of the movement,
giving date and hour of receipt and delivery, can be taken
from the record. This is frequently of the greatest value.</p>

<p>In addition to this, it is customary now for nearly all roads to
exchange what are known as "junction cards." They are reports
from one to another giving the numbers of all cars of each road
passing junction stations. These junction reports when received
are also carefully noted in the record, so that an account is kept in
a measure of the movement of home cars while on foreign roads,
and their daily location.</p>

<p>It would be difficult, and beyond the scope of this article, to
tell of the great variety of uses these records are put to. They
serve as a check upon reports of the mileage clerks, insuring
their accuracy. The junction reports serve also in a measure to
check the reports of foreign roads. Then, at frequent intervals, a
clerk will go over the record and note every car that is not shown
to have moved within, say, five days, putting down on a "detention
report" for each station the car number and date of its arrival.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
These reports are sent to the agents for explanation, and then submitted
to the Superintendent. In a similar manner reports will
be made showing any use locally of foreign cars. From the record
can be shown almost at a glance the location of all idle cars,
information that is often very valuable, and that when wanted is
wanted promptly. Also, from the record, reports are constantly
being made out&mdash;"tracers," as they are termed&mdash;showing the location
and detention of home cars on foreign roads. In turn, foreign
tracers are taken to the record, and the questions therein asked
are readily answered by the Car Accountant.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, the distribution of empty cars upon the
line should be under the direct supervision of the Car Accountant.
Where this matter is left to a clerk in the Superintendent's office,
or, as has often been the case, is left to the discretion of yardmasters
and agents, the utmost waste in the use of cars is inevitable.
An agent at a local station will want a car for a particular
shipment. If he has none at his station suitable he will ask some
neighboring agent; failing there, he will ask the Superintendent's
office, and frequently also the nearest yardmaster. Some other
agent at a distant station may want the same kind of car; orders
in this way become duplicated, and the road will not only have to
haul twice the number of cars needed, but very often haul the same
kind of cars empty in opposite directions at the same time. This
is no uncommon occurrence even on well-managed roads, and, it
is needless to say, is most expensive.</p>

<p>Where the cars are distributed under the direct supervision of
the Car Accountant, he has the record at hand constantly, and
knows exactly where all cars are, and the sources of supply to
meet every demand. Not only that, but every improper use of
cars is at once brought to light and corrected.</p>

<p>The <em>theory</em> of the use of foreign cars is that they are permitted
to run through to destination with through freight, on condition
that they shall be promptly unloaded on arrival at destination;
that they shall be returned at once to the home road, being loaded
on the return trip if suitable loading is available; but by no means
allowed to be used in local service, or loaded in any other direction
than homeward.</p>

<p>The <em>practice</em> of many agents, and many roads, too, unfortu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>nately,
is hardly in keeping with this theory. Agents, especially
if not closely watched, are prone to put freight into any car that
is at hand, regardless of ownership, being urged to such course
by the importunities of shippers and, at times, by the scarcity of
cars. Frequently such irregularities are the result of pure carelessness,
agents using foreign cars for local shipments, simply because
they are on hand, rather than call for home cars which it
may take some trouble and delay to procure. In this way at times
a large amount of local business may be going on on one part of
the road in foreign cars, while but a few miles distant the company's
cars may be standing idle. The Car Accountant from his
record can at once put a stop to this, and prevent its recurrence.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_280.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Freight Pier, North River, New York.</div>
</div>

<p>Another valuable use to which the Car Accountant's Office may
be put is to trace and keep a record of the movement of freight,
locating delays, and tracing for freight lost or damaged. By a
moderate use of the telegraph wire the Car Accountant can keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
track of the movement of special freight-trains concerning which
time is important, and so insure regularity and promptness in their
despatch and delivery. From the mileage records may be obtained
the work of each engine in freight service, the miles run,
the number of loaded and empty cars hauled; and by considering
two, or perhaps three, empty cars as equivalent to one loaded car,
the average number of loaded cars hauled per mile is obtained.
The information is often valuable, as on many roads the ability of
a Superintendent is measured to a considerable extent by the
amount of work performed by the engines at his command.</p>

<p>In many other ways the resources of the Car Accountant's
office will be found of the greatest value to the Superintendent.
When the office is once fully organized and systematized, and all
in good working order, the Superintendent will find that his capacity
for control of his cars has been more than doubled, while
the demands on his time for their care has been really lessened.
He has all the information he needs supplied at his desk, far more
accurate than any he was ever able to secure before, and in the
most condensed form; while, at the same time, he will find his
freight improving in time over his line, his agents will have cars
more promptly and in greater abundance than ever, and last, and
most gratifying of all, his monthly balance-sheets will show a
steady decrease in the amount his road pays for foreign-car mileage,
until probably the balance will be found in his favor, although
his business and consequent tonnage may have increased meanwhile.</p>


<h3>III.<br />

<span class="fs70">USE AND ABUSE OF CARS.</span></h3>

<p>A package of merchandise can be transported from New York
to Chicago in two days and three nights. This is repeated day
after day with all the regularity of passenger service. So uniform
is this movement, that shippers and consignees depend upon it
and arrange their sales and stocks of goods in accordance therewith.
Any deviation or irregularity brings forth instant complaint
and a threatened withdrawal of patronage. This is true of hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>dreds
of other places and lines of freight service. To accomplish
it, there is necessary, first, a highly complicated and intricate organization,
and, next, incessant watchfulness.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_282.jpg" width="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Hay Storage Warehouses, New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, West Thirty-third Street, New York.</div>
</div>

<p>The shipper delivers the goods at the receiving freight-house
of the railway company. His cartman gets a receipt from the
tallyman. This receipt may be sent direct to the consignee, or
more frequently is exchanged for a bill of lading. There the responsibility
of the shipper ends. His goods are in the hands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the railway company, which to all intents and purposes guarantees
their safe and prompt delivery to the consignee.</p>

<p>The tallyman's receipt is taken in duplicate. The latter is
kept in the freight-house until the freight is loaded in a car, and is
then marked with the initials and number of the car into which
the freight has been loaded. After that it is taken to the bill clerk
in the office, and from it and others is made the waybill or bills
for that particular car.</p>

<p>Where the volume of freight received at a given station is
large, it is customary to put all packages for a common destination,
as far as possible, in a car by themselves, thus making what
are termed "straight" cars. This is not always possible, however,
or if attempted would lead to loading a very large number
of cars with but light loads. So that it becomes necessary to
group freight for contiguous stations in one car, and again often
to put freight for widely distant cities in the same car. These
latter are known as "mixed" cars.</p>

<p>We will assume the day's receipt of freight finished, and most
of the cars loaded. About 6 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> the house will be "pulled," that
is, those cars already loaded will be taken away, and an empty
"string" of cars put in their place. An hour later, this "string"
will in turn be loaded and taken out, and the operation repeated,
until all the day's receipt of freight is loaded. Meanwhile other
freight will have been loaded direct from the shippers' carts on to
cars on the receiving tracks. For all cars, there is made out in the
freight-office a running slip or memorandum bill, which gives simply
the car number, initials, and destination. These are given to the
yardmaster or despatcher, and from them he "makes up" the trains.</p>

<p>To a very great degree, the good movement of freight depends
upon the vigilance of the yardmasters and the care with which
they execute their duties. In an important terminal yard, the
yardmaster may have at all times from one to two thousand cars,
loaded and empty. He must know what each car contains, what
is its destination, and on what track it is. To enable him to do
this, he has one or more assistants, day and night. They, in turn,
will have foremen in charge of yard crews, each of the latter having
immediate charge of one engine. The number of engines employed
will vary constantly with the volume of the freight handled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
but it is safe to assume that there will be at all times nearly as
many engines employed in shifting in the various yards and important
stations on a line as there are road engines used in the
movement of the freight traffic.</p>

<p>The work of the yard goes on without intermission day and
night, Sundays as well as week-days. The men there employed
know no holidays, get no vacations. The loaded cars are coming
from the freight-houses all day long, in greater numbers perhaps
in the afternoon and evening, but the work of loading and moving
cars goes on somewhere or other, at nearly all times. As often
as the yardmaster gets together a sufficient number of cars for a
common destination to make up a train, he gathers them together,
orders a road engine and crew to be ready, and despatches them.
In the make up of "through" trains, care has to be exercised to
put together cars going to the same point, and to "group" the
trains so that as little shifting as possible may be required at any
succeeding yard or terminal, where the trains may pass. To accomplish
this, a thorough knowledge of all the various routes is
necessary, and minute acquaintance with the various intermediate
junction yards and stations.</p>

<p>The train once "made up" and in charge of the road crew, its
progress for the next few hours is comparatively simple. It will
go the length of the "run" at a rate of probably twenty miles per
hour, subject only to the ordinary vicissitudes of the road. At
the end of the division, if a through train, it will be promptly transferred
to another road crew with another engine, and so on.
Each conductor takes the running slip for each car in his train.
He also makes a report, giving the cars in his train by numbers
and initials, whether loaded or empty, how secured; and detailed
information in regard to any car out of order, or any slight mishap
or delay to his train. These reports go to the Car Accountant.
The running slips stay with the cars, being transferred from hand
to hand until the cars reach their destination. At junction yards
where one road terminates and connects with one or more foreign
roads, a complete record is kept, in a book prepared especially
for the purpose, of every car received from and delivered to each
connecting road. A copy of this information is sent daily to the
Car Accountant.</p>

<p>A road is expected
to receive back from a connecting

previously delivered loaded. It
becomes very necessary to know
just what cars have been so delivered.
Without such a record
a road is at the mercy of its connections,

had in its possession before, thus paying mileage and being at the
expense of moving cars that brought it no revenue whatever. The

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_288a.jpg" width="175" alt="" />
</div>

<p>To still more expedite the movement of through freight, very
many so-called fast freight lines exist in this country, as, for example,
the Traders' Despatch, the Star Union, the Merchants' Despatch
Transportation Company, the Red, the White, the Blue,
the National Despatch, etc. Some of these lines are simply co-operative
lines, owned by the various railway companies whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
roads are operated in connection with one another. Their organization
is simple. A number of companies organize a line, which
they put in charge of a general manager. Each company will assign
to the line a number of cars, the quota
of each being in proportion to its miles of
road. The general manager has control
of the line cars. He has agents who solicit
business and employees who watch the
movement of his line cars, and report the
same to him. He keeps close record of
his business, and reports promptly to the
transportation officer of any road in his
line any neglect or delinquency he may
discover. The earnings of the line and its
expenses are all divided <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro rata</i> among
the roads interested. Such a line is simply an organization to insure
prompt service and secure competitive business, and the entire
benefit goes to the railway companies.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_288b.jpg" width="175" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Other lines are in the nature of corporations, being owned by
stockholders and operating on a system of roads in accordance
with some agreement or contract. Others, again, are organized
for some special freight, and are owned wholly by firms or individuals,
such as the various dressed-beef lines and some lines of
live-stock cars. These are put in service
simply for the mileage received for their use,
and in many cases the railway companies have
no interest in them whatever.</p>

<p>The movement of "straight" cars and
"solid" trains is comparatively simple. But
there is a very large amount of through freight,
particularly of merchandise, that cannot be put
into a "straight" car. A shipper in New York
can depend on his goods going in a straight
car to St. Louis, Denver, St. Paul, etc., but he
can hardly expect a straight car to any one of hundreds of intermediate
cities and towns. Still less is it possible for a road at a
small country-town, where there are perhaps but one or two factories,
to load straight cars to any but a very few places. To over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>come
this difficulty, transfer freight-houses have to be provided.
These are usually located at important terminal stations.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_289a.jpg" width="200" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Coal Car, Central Railroad of New Jersey.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To them are billed all mixed cars containing through freight.
These cars are unloaded and reloaded, and out of a hundred
"mixed" cars will be made probably
eighty straight and the balance local.
This necessarily causes some delay, but
it is practically a gain in time in the end,
as otherwise every car would have to be
reloaded, and held at every station for
which it contained freight.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_289b.jpg" width="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The variety of articles that is offered
to a railway company for transportation is endless. Articles of all
sizes and weights are carried, from shoe-pegs by the carload to a
single casting that weighs thirty tons. The values also vary as
widely. Some cars will carry kindling wood or refuse stone that
is worth barely the cost of loading and carrying a few miles, while
others will be loaded with teas, silks, or merchandise, where perhaps
the value of a single carload will exceed twenty-five or thirty
thousand dollars. The great bulk of all freight is carried in the
ordinary box-cars, coal in cars especially planned for it, and coarse
lumber and stone on flat or platform cars. But very many cases
arise that require especial provision to be made for each. Chicago
dressed beef has made the use of the refrigerator cars well known.
These cars are also used for carrying fruit and provisions. They
are of many kinds, built under various patents,
but all with a common purpose; that is, to
produce a car wherein the temperature can
be maintained uniformly at about 40 degrees.
On the other hand, potatoes in bulk are
brought in great quantities to the Eastern
seaboard in box-cars, fitted with an additional
or false lining of boards, and in the centre an ordinary stove
in which fire is kept up during the time the potatoes are in
transit.</p>

<p>An improvement on this plan is afforded by the use of cars
known as the Eastman Heater Cars. They are provided with an
automatic self-feeding oil-stove, so arranged that fire can be kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
up under the car for about a fortnight without attention. These

<p>For carrying milk, special cars have to be provided, as particular

with a small amount of cooling for the proper carrying of
the milk. Not only the cars but the train service has to be especially

<p>As an instance, the Long Island Railroad Company makes a
specialty of transporting farmers' truck-wagons to market. For
this purpose they have provided long, low, flat cars, each capable
of carrying four truck-wagons. The horses are carried in box-cars,
and one farmer or driver is carried with each team, a coach
being provided for their use. During the fall of the year, they frequently
carry from 45 to 50 wagons on one train, charging a small
sum for each wagon, and nothing for the horses or men. These
trains run three times weekly, and are arranged so as to arrive
in the city about midnight, returning the next day at noon. The
trains by themselves are not very remunerative, but by furnishing
this accommodation, farmers who are thirty or forty miles out on
Long Island can have just as good an opportunity for market-gardening
as those who live within driving distance of the city.

This builds up the country farther out on the island, which in turn
gives the road other business.</p>

<p>The movement of freight is not always successfully accomplished.
In spite of good organization, every facility, incessant
watchfulness, accidents will occur, freight will be delayed, cars will
break down, trains will meet with disaster. The consequences
sometimes fall heavily on the railway companies. The loss is frequently
out of all proportion to the revenue. The following instance
is from the writers own experience:</p>

<p>Some carpenters repairing a small low trestle left chips and
shavings near one of the bents. A passing train dropped some
ashes. The shavings caught fire and burnt one or two posts in one
bent. The section-men failed to notice the fire. Toward evening
a freight train came to the trestle, the burnt bent gave way, and
the train was derailed. Two men were killed, one severely injured,
and eighteen freight cars were burned. The resulting loss
to the railroad company was $56,113. Of this amount, the loss
paid on freight was $39,613.12. As a matter of interest, and to
show the disparity between the value of the commodities and the
earnings from freight charges received by the railway company,
the amount of each is given here in detail, taken from the actual
records of the case:</p>

<p>This was during the fall of 1882, when hops sold in New York

<p>The plan of payment for car service by the mile run, without
reference to time, has the merit of simplicity and long-established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
usage. It is, however, in reality, crude and unscientific, and has
brought with it, in its train, numerous disadvantages.</p>

<p>The owner of a car is entitled, first, to the proper interest in
his investment, that is, on the value of the car; second, to a proper
amount for wear and tear or for repairs. The life of a freight car
may be reasonably estimated at ten years, so that ten per cent. on
its value would be a fair interest-charge. The average amount
for repairs varies directly as to the distance the car moves, and
may be put at one-half cent per mile run.</p>

<p>It will be seen that by the ordinary method of payment the car-owner
is compensated for interest at the rate of ¼ of a cent for the
time that the car is in motion, but receives nothing for all the time
the car is at rest. If cars could be kept in motion for any considerable
portion of each twenty-four hours, this would prove ample.
But in practice it is found that few roads succeed in getting an
average movement of all cars for more than one hour and a half in
each twenty-four. This gives about five per cent. interest on the
value of the car, only one-half of what is generally conceded to be
a fair return. Still further, there is no inducement to the road on
which a foreign car is standing to hasten its return home. On the
contrary, there is a direct advantage in holding the car idle until
a proper load can be found for it, rather than return it home empty.
The most serious abuses of the freight business of the country
have grown from this state of affairs. It costs nothing but the use
of the track to hold freight in cars; consequently freight is held in
cars instead of being put in storehouses, frequently for weeks and
months at a time.</p>

<p>There is but little earnest attempt made to urge consignees to
remove freight; on the contrary, the consignees consider that they
can leave their freight as long as they choose, and that the railroad
companies are bound to hold it indefinitely.</p>

<p>One special practice has grown up as a result of this condition,
that of shippers sending freight to distant points to their own
order. This practice is most prolific of detention to cars, and yet
is so strongly rooted in the traffic arrangements of the country
that it is most difficult to put an end to it. Cars "to order" will
frequently stand for weeks before the contents are sold and the
consignee is discovered, during which time the cars accumulate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
stand in the way, occupy
valuable space, and have
to be handled repeatedly
by the transportation department
of the road, all
at the direct cost of
handling to the road itself,
and loss of interest
to the owner of the car.</p>

<p>Only two methods have so far been suggested to abate or put
an end to the evils which have been but slightly indicated above.
The first is a change in the method of payment for car service to a
compensation based upon time as well as mileage, which is commonly
known as the "per diem plan."</p>

<p>This plan consists in paying for the use of all foreign cars a
fixed sum per mile run, based on the supposed cost of repairs of
the car, and a price per day based upon what is estimated to be a
fair return for the interest on its value. This plan was originally
suggested by a convention of car accountants, and was brought up
and advocated by Mr. Fink, the Chairman of the Trunk Line Commission,
in New York, in the fall of 1887. At his suggestion, and
largely through his influence, it was tried by a few of the roads
(the Trunk Lines and some of their immediate connections) during
the early part of the year 1888; the amounts as then fixed being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
one-half cent per mile run, and fifteen cents per day. The results
of this experiment, while they were quite satisfactory to the friends
of the proposed change, yet were not sufficiently conclusive to
demonstrate the value of the plan to those who were indifferent or
hostile to it.</p>

    of this experiment, while they were quite satisfactory to the friends
    of the proposed change, yet were not sufficiently conclusive to
    demonstrate the value of the plan to those who were indifferent or
    hostile to it.</p>
    </div>

<p>For various reasons, chiefly local to the roads in question, the
plan was discontinued after a few months' trial. The experiment
resulted, however, in the collection of a large mass of statistics
and other data, the study of which has led many to believe that
the plan is the proper solution of the difficulties experienced, and, if
adjusted so as not to add too much to the burden of those railway
companies who are borrowers of cars, that it would meet with the
approval of the railway companies throughout the country. It certainly
provided a strong inducement to all roads to promptly handle
foreign cars, and in that particular it proved a great advance over
the existing methods of car service. The charge per day of fifteen
cents was found too high in practice. Ten cents per day and a half-cent
per mile would produce a net sum to the car-owner very
slightly in excess of three-fourths of a cent per mile run. While
this appears but small, yet it would be quite sufficient to amount
in the aggregate to a considerable sum, and would serve to urge
all railway companies to promptly unload and send home foreign
cars. This plan would result, if generally adopted, in largely increasing
the daily movement or mileage of all cars, or, what would
be equivalent, would practically amount to a very considerable increase
in the equipment of the country.</p>

<p>The plan has recently been approved by the General Time
Convention, and there is strong probability that it will be very extensively
adopted and given a trial by all the railways during the
year 1890.</p>

<p>The second method of remedying the existing evils of car service
is in a uniform and regular charge for demurrage, or car rental,
to be collected by all railroad companies with the same regularity
and uniformity that they now collect freight charges. This car
rental, or demurrage charge, would not be in any sense a revenue
to the car-owner; the idea of it being that it is a rental to the delivering
company, not only for the use of the car but for the track
on which it stands, and the inconvenience and actual cost that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
company is put to in repeated handling a car that is held awaiting
the pleasure of the consignee to unload. The difficulty in the
way of making such a charge has been the unwillingness of any
railroad company to put any obstacle in the way of the free movement
of freight to its line, and the fear that an equivalent charge
would not be made by some one of its competitors. Of late, however,
the serious disadvantages resulting from the privileges given
to consignees at competing points, by allowing them to hold cars
indefinitely, have led the different railway companies to come together
and agree upon a uniform system of demurrage charges at
certain competing points.</p>

<p>If these two plans could be put into operation simultaneously,
a fair and uniform method of charging demurrage, coupled with
the per diem and mileage plan for car service, the results would
be most satisfactory not only to the railway companies and car-owners,
but also to the community.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The matter of freight transportation is a vast one, and whole
chapters might be written on any one of the various topics that
have been but slightly mentioned in this sketch.</p>

<p>The subject is fraught with difficulties; new complications
arise daily which, each in its turn, have to be met and mastered.
The publicity recently given to the various phases of the railway
problem has done much to enlighten the public mind in regard to
these difficulties.</p>

<p>The result has already been evident in the growing spirit of
mutual forbearance and good-will between the railway companies
and the public. Let us hope that this will continue, and that as
time goes on their relations will steadily improve, so that the public,
while yielding nothing of their legitimate demand for safe, prompt,
and convenient service, will at the same time see that this can only
be secured by allowing the railways a fair return for the services
rendered; while the railways will learn that their true interest lies
in the best service possible at moderate, uniform rates.</p>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_298dc.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">The commissary or supply department of a railroad
is not unlike that of a large army. Like a vast
army, its necessities are many, and the various departments
which make up the whole system must
be provided with their necessary requirements in
order to accomplish the end for which it is operated.</p>

<p>If, again, we regard a railroad as a huge animal, the quantity
of supplies needed to fill its capacious maw is something overwhelming.
It is always hungry, and the daily bill of fare (which
includes pretty much everything known to trade) is gone through
with an appetite as vigorous and healthy at the end as it exhibits
in the beginning. Yet how few there are who realize the important
part this one feature plays in the operation of the thousands of
miles of railroad throughout the world! Upon the proper conduct
of this department depends very largely the success of any road,
so far as its relation to the stockholders is concerned; for while,
as has been the case in the past, combinations and pools have
aided in maintaining rates, and have served to increase the income,
and attention has been paid to securing additional business
in every possible way, the "out-goes" have often been overlooked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
to the detriment of dividends and the general welfare of
the property.</p>

<p>The supplies must be furnished in any event, in order that the
various departments may perform their allotted duties&mdash;coal for the
engines, stationery for the clerks, ties and rails for the tracks, oils
for the lubrication of the thousands of axles daily turning, passage-tickets
for the travellers, and a thousand and one things which are
absolutely necessary for the safe and efficient conduct of every railroad
in active operation. Each item serves its purpose, and,
properly assimilated, keeps alive all the functions of one vast and
complicated system. It is easy to see, then, the importance, first,
of proper economy in buying, and then a correct and systematic
distribution of all supplies. On the Philadelphia &amp; Reading
Railroad, for instance, the annual supply bills aggregate more than
$3,000,000, covering such supplies as those just mentioned, and, in
fact, everything which is purchased and used in the operation of
the road; so that on a large system like that, the commissary department
requires no end of detail, both in the purchase and the
distribution of all material.</p>

<p>The expenditure for lubricating oils, waste, and greases alone
amounts to more than $150,000 per annum, while the outlay for fuel
represents about $1,200,000, and this is comparatively a small sum,
since that road is a coal road, so called, and the cost for fuel, as a
matter of course, is reduced to a minimum. There the store-room
system, which has now been pretty generally adopted by many of
the larger roads, is fully exemplified. With a General Store-keeper
in charge, all supplies purchased are accounted for through
him, and distributions are made daily among the sub-store rooms,
which are located at convenient points; and they in turn distribute
among the various departments, for consumption, all accounting
daily to the General Store-keeper at Reading.</p>

<p>To give an idea as to the quantity of material required in the
service on such a road, it may be stated that from twelve to fifteen
car-loads of supplies per day are shipped to various points.
When we consider that an ordinary car will carry from fifteen to
twenty tons of freight, we find that the annual requirements will
average about four thousand car-loads, or, say, about fifty thousand
tons, and if all the cars were made up into one solid train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
they would occupy fully twenty-five miles of track, and consume
an hour and a half passing a given point running at the ordinary
speed of freight-trains.</p>

<p>To account carefully for all this requires necessarily a large
army of clerks and other assistants, though, with the fundamental
principles correct, it is no more difficult to account for large quantities
than for small. The supplies are purchased in the first instance,
delivered at the General Storehouse, are there weighed
or measured and receipted for, are then distributed on requisition,
and finally delivered to the several departments when needed;
are charged out to the various accounts, after consumption, and
all returns and records are finally kept on the books of the General
Store-keeper.</p>

<p>It would be a large army indeed which would require so much
for its maintenance; and, remembering the hundreds of roads,
small and large, throughout the country, the measure of one's
comprehension is nearly reached in estimating the amount of
money and the thousands of tons of material represented.</p>

<p>If the buyer of railroad stocks for investment, besides looking
into the returns of freight and passenger business for his decision,
would investigate carefully the method adopted for the purchase
and distribution of supplies on any road in which he may be interested,
he might get information enough to satisfy himself that a
large portion of the earnings were dribbling out through this department,
and that, as a result, his stock might eventually cease
to be a dividend payer.</p>

<p>In the matter of buying, the result depends entirely upon the
purchasing agent, and this position must necessarily be occupied
by a man of honor and integrity, coupled with a reasonable amount
of shrewdness and aptitude for such business. As this department
covers to a greater or less degree pretty much all the known
branches of trade, the buyer cannot, under ordinary circumstances,
thoroughly master the whole field as an expert; but he can nevertheless
inform himself in the most important articles of manufacture
to the extent of preventing deception or fraud. The field is
extensive, and the sooner railroad companies realize that the purchasing
agent is not a mere order clerk, the sooner they will discover
that their disbursements for supplies are very much less,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
and that the chief part of the leakage has found its source in this
very department.</p>

<p>Exactly the same principles are involved in this matter as in
the case of a thrifty proprietor of a country-store, whose profits
each year depend materially upon the closeness and care with
which his stock in trade is purchased from the wholesale dealers
in a large city. A purchasing agent's experience is varied in the
extreme, dealing as he does with all classes of salesmen and business
houses. There is no end to the operations which skilful
salesmen go through in offering their stock; but after some experience
a sharp buyer will be able to fortify himself against the
best of them&mdash;even against the clever vender of varnishes who
disposed of one hundred barrels of his wares in small lots to different
buyers, on a sample of maple-sirup. On the other hand,
a salesman who, when a buyer asked him if his oil gummed, replied
that "it gummed beautifully," lost the chance of ever selling
any goods in that quarter.</p>

<p>As has been said, the ordinary or general supplies consumed
in the operation of the average railroad include almost everything
known to trade. Tobacco, for the gratification of the taste of a
gang of men out on the road with the snow-plough, is not outside
the list; and even pianos, for some trains (since the days of absolute
comfort and possible extravagance have begun) for the benefit
of passengers setting out on long journeys; nor do we lose sight
of books, bath-tubs, and barbers. The practical feature involved,
however, calls for an endless variety of expensive as well as inexpensive
materials.</p>

<p>It is a safe rule to follow that anything which goes into the
construction either of track, equipment, or buildings, should be
the best. Care should always be exercised against the use of any
material the failure of which might be the cause of loss of life, and
consequently result in heavy damages to the company. Iron alone
enters so extensively into railroad construction and operation that
it is safe to say three-fourths of all manufactured in this country is
consumed directly or indirectly in this way; and besides its use in
rails and fastenings (the latter including spikes, fish-plates, and bolts
and nuts), and in the many thousand tons of car-wheels and axles
annually required, there must be reckoned the almost unlimited number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
of castings daily required in the way of brake-shoes, pedestals,
draw-heads, grate-bars, etc. The lumber and timber for buildings,
bridges, platforms, and crossings, and the large quantity of glass
which is necessary, are among other large items of expenditure.</p>

<p>Lubricating and illuminating oils, paints and varnishes, soaps,
chalk, bunting, hardware, lamps, cotton and woollen waste, clocks,
brooms, and such metals as copper, pig tin, and antimony are only
a few of the many articles of diet which a railroad requires to keep
body and soul together, and give it strength to perform the great
duty it owes to commerce and the public. After they have all
served their purposes, such as cannot be worked over again in the
shops, and are not entirely consumed, are consigned to the scrap-heap
under the head of "old material"&mdash;an all-important consideration
in the economical management of any road. On many
roads very little attention is paid to the sale of scrap. As a general
rule, the purchasing agent has charge of it, and if he shows
any shrewdness in buying, he will exercise more or less ingenuity
in selling. Most railroad scrap has a fixed value in the market.
Quotations for old rails, car-wheels, and wrought iron are found
in all the trade journals; but as in buying one can usually buy of
someone at prices less than market price, so in selling he can often
find a buyer who is willing to pay more than the regular quotation.
As it is found not wise in the long run to purchase ahead
on some prospective rise, so in selling it is equally true that holding
scrap over upon the possibility of a rise in prices is not always
for the best advantage.</p>

<p>There has always been a demand for old iron rails, and recently
use for old steel rails has been found. They are worked over at
the rolling mills into crowbars and shovels, spikes, fish-plates,
bolts, and other necessary things to be employed in construction
and maintenance. Not long since an experiment with old steel
rails was successfully performed, whereby they were melted and
poured into moulds for use as brake-shoes. The result showed a
casting of unusual hardness which would outwear three ordinary
cast-iron shoes. This opens up an entirely new field in railroad
economy, for with ordinary foundry appliances accumulations of
old steel rails can be worked over and cast into all sorts of shapes
and patterns to better advantage than selling them at a nominal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
price to outside buyers. While worn-out car-wheels will generally
bring more money from wheel manufacturers than they command
in the open market, it has not always been found the best
policy to compel the mill from which the new wheels are purchased
to take too many of them. It is apt to encourage the use
of too much old material in the manufacture of the new; and while
the company may consider that it is realizing much more money
on sales of the old wheels than the market price, it does not take
into account the inferior stock it is getting back, or the fact that
possibly when the mileage is reckoned the wheels have signally
failed to run as long as they ought. In the aggregate about ten
per cent. of the original cost of all supplies purchased is realized
out of the sales of old material. From cast-iron wheels and old
rails, however, the percentage is much larger, for while at present
new passenger car-wheels of this class, weighing about five hundred
and fifty pounds, are worth about ten dollars each, they will
bring in the market, when worn out after running say fifty thousand
miles, about twenty dollars per ton. Four wheels go to the
ton, which represents five dollars per wheel, or fifty per cent.
of the original cost. With old rails the percentage is even higher,
in the present condition of the rail market. Old iron rails are
worth within four or five dollars of the price of new steel, and the
old steel about seventy per cent. of the price of the new. These
high percentages assist in making up for the materials which are
entirely consumed in the service, and which never form a part of
the ordinary scrap-heap, such as oils, waste, and paints.</p>

<p>While the majority of general supplies just mentioned briefly
may be arranged for as required and purchased from month to
month upon regular requisitions, there are certain staple articles
which are provided for in advance by contract. Among them
principally are the engine-coal, rails and ties, stationery, passage-tickets,
and time-tables. More money is expended for such supplies
than for any others, and contracts with responsible business
houses, for their delivery at fixed prices for the limit of at least a
year, are generally made to insure, in the first place, the lowest
market rates and, again, to make the delivery certain.</p>

<p>Locomotive fuel is the largest single item of expense in the
operation of any road, the consumption of it running up as high as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
a million tons per annum on some large roads; and while there are
a few exceptional cases where wood is used as fuel, coal is the
necessary element in nearly every case in America to-day.</p>

<p>Of the two general varieties&mdash;bituminous or soft, and anthracite
or hard&mdash;it is safe to say that bituminous coal is the more
economical, assuming that the grade employed is the best, this
economy lying both in the original cost and the fact that the bulk
of it goes to serve its purpose, there being comparatively little
waste in the way of ashes; while the anthracite produces many
ashes and clinkers, requires much more care and attention on the
part of the stoker or fireman, and costs, as a general rule, about
thirty per cent. more. Economy, however, should not be carried
too far in any branch of the service, and if the passenger traffic be
heavy the use of soft coal may be a great detriment. To a traveller
there can be nothing more disagreeable than the smoke and
cinders emanating from it; and if, besides this, the road be an
especially dusty one, the combination of dust, smoke, and cinders
will be quite sufficient to turn the tide of travel in some other
direction and over another route.</p>

<p>For freight service bituminous coal is decidedly the best, and
perhaps might not be out of place on short local passenger trains;
but the company that provides hard-coal-burning engines for
passenger trains, and soft-coal burners for freight, does about the
right thing, and economizes as far as practicable in this particular.
In making contracts for this important commodity the necessity of
careful tests in advance is very apparent, and such trials are
generally left with the best engineers and firemen; otherwise it
might be difficult to get at all the qualifications. On some roads
inducements offered to firemen have brought the consumption of
fuel down to the most economical point, and it is surprising how
much depends upon their good judgment in this matter.</p>

<p>Now that heating cars direct from the engines is coming into
general use, and State legislatures have given the subject their consideration,
the consumption of the domestic sizes of coal as fuel in
cars is growing less; but this, too, is still a very important matter.</p>

<p>Stationery is not only a very significant item, but also an expensive
one. This includes all the forms and blanks used in the conduct
of the freight and passenger business, and there is an endless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
variety of them&mdash;the inks, pens, pencils, mucilage, sealing-wax, and
envelopes, besides many other odds and ends. Perhaps the envelopes
represent one of the largest single items of expense in
this line. The hundreds of thousands of them used in the course
of a year, even at low prices, mean an outlay of many thousands
of dollars. Agents must send in daily reports, there must be covers
for all the correspondence passing between the different departments,
while the daily average amount of outside correspondence
is very considerable. It is surprising how many dollars might be
saved in this direction, not only by a judicious contract, but by a
careful use of the supply.</p>

<p>When a railroad company takes up the question of time-tables,
it has a matter of importance to handle which on many roads receives
very little consideration. When the passenger traffic is
heavy, the number of travellers during the year running into the
millions, the demand for time-tables is very large. This refers
directly to the time-table sheets or folders, which every company
must keep on hand at its stations, and in other public places and
hotels, for the convenience of the traveller, in addition to the
printed schedules which are framed and hung up conspicuously on
the walls of its waiting-rooms. A neat and attractive folder for
general circulation is very desirable, particularly if competition is
very strong. There is more virtue in a neatly made up schedule
of trains than one would suppose. One in doubt is apt to reason
that the road is kept up in a corresponding condition, and that the
trains are made up on the same plan, and consequently would prefer
to go by that route rather than by one whose trains were advertised
on cheap leaflets.</p>

<p>Fifteen thousand to twenty thousand dollars per annum for
envelopes alone is spent on some roads, and twice as much more
perhaps for time-tables.</p>

<p>Passage-tickets, including all varieties of regular and special
tickets, such as mileage books or coupons, family trip-books, and
school-tickets are also an item of large expense, the annual consumption
covering many tons, which once used are of no value
save as waste paper; yet they are absolutely indispensable in the
operation of the road. Yearly contracts for these are made, and
while the actual cost of a single ticket may not exceed <em>one mill</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the aggregate on a road carrying fifteen millions to twenty millions
or more passengers per annum is considerable.</p>

<p>To induce the public to travel, and encourage shippers to send
their freight to market over any road, attention must first be paid
to the condition of the track and rolling stock.</p>

<p>It is not economy to allow anything to be out of repair, on the
supposition that it is less expensive than it would be to spend comparatively
little from day to day to keep it up. The day of reckoning
will come in the end, and the sacrifice will be considerable.
As the track is the fundamental feature, the cross-ties or sleepers
and rails should be the best. Iron rails are practically out of date,
and it is fair to assume that the time is approaching when wooden
ties will be things of the past. Where the traffic is light, heavy
steel rails may not be necessary; but it has been generally found
economical to put in use rails which do not weigh less than sixty-seven
or seventy pounds to the yard; an even greater weight than
this is not ill-advised&mdash;they require fewer cross-ties to the mile,
and in consequence the force of men required to keep the track in
condition is less. Light rails are soon worn and battered out on a
road over which heavy engines are run and large trains are hauled.
The powerful locomotives now built require a well-kept track and
a solid and substantial road-bed. Heavier and faster trains have
tended to reduce the average life of rails, even though the weight
of the rails has also been steadily increasing. Circumstances vary
on the different roads, but it is safe to say that eight to ten per
cent. of all rails in the track must be renewed every year. This
brings the average life of the steel rails down to about twelve years,
under ordinary conditions. On some divisions, however, where
the traffic is frequent, and in yards where a good deal of switching
is done, and the rails are under pressure constantly, the average
is, of course, very much less&mdash;even as low as two or three years.</p>

<p>Aside from the durability of the timber employed, plenty of face
for the rail bearings, and uniform thickness and length, are very
important requirements in contracts for ties. While white oak is
generally considered the most durable for this purpose, the growth
of this timber is limited except in certain sections of the country,
so that cedar, cypress, chestnut, and yellow pine are more commonly
used than any other class. The millions of them used for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
renewals and new roads each year are gradually reducing our
forests; and, like some of the European roads, we shall some day
fall back upon metal, which (while its life may not be measured)
will make so rigid a track that the traveller over long distances
will be worn out with his journey, and the rolling stock will require
frequent repairs and overhauling. The practice of creosoting
cross-ties is growing rapidly, and this tends to increase their durability
three or four times. While the first cost of such ties may be
double that for the unprepared timbers, the result in the end is
economical, for the labor alone required to take out an old tie and
put in a new one costs at least twelve cents.</p>

<p>The general store-room is properly the intermediate stage, so
far as supplies are concerned, between the different departments of
the road and the Auditor, who charges up all material used to the
different accounts into which his system is divided. Properly,
everything in the nature of material, however small, directly or indirectly
passes through the Store-keeper's books. An account is
kept with each locomotive, station agent, switchman, and flagman,
so that to a penny everything consumed in the operation of a road
is accurately known. To accomplish this the Store-keeper, of
course, must be a good accountant, and at the same time be more
or less of an expert in railroad material. Under an economical administration
of his affairs he is able to save a great deal of money
for his company. By his system, with the aid of data from the mechanical
department, he can tell the average number of miles run
during the year to a pint of oil or a ton of coal; the number of
pounds of coal consumed per mile run, as well as the number of
pints of oil for the same distance. He can give in detail the cost
in cents per mile run for all the oil, tallow, and waste, fuel, and
other supplies consumed, and can account to a nicety for all the
lanterns, brooms, hardware, and other material which he has received
and distributed.</p>

<p>He will find that some engineers and firemen are more extravagant
than others, and that some station agents and flagmen do
not perform their respective duties with near so much regard for
economy as others do under exactly similar circumstances. In
such cases a report is made and a reminder from the Superintendent
follows, calling attention to such carelessness. The result is
apparent at the next monthly comparison.</p>

<p>Prompt payment of all supply bills helps to insure economy,
and any company unable to make its payments promptly and regularly,
suffers to a greater or less extent always; for a firm not able
to know whether its accounts are to be settled in thirty or ninety
days cannot afford to allow all the discounts which it otherwise
might, and this may mean an extra expense every year of many
thousands of dollars.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So far as the employees are concerned, it is for the best interests
of the company to have a fixed time for the pay-day. They
need their money and should get it regularly. Any road on which
the men are paid at uncertain times may be subject to incalculable
losses. It is apt to provoke dishonesty and carelessness. The
road which is bankrupt and forced to pass its pay-day to some indefinite
time is always hampered by some of the most inferior class
of servants in the market. Except in some instances where special
laws have been passed requiring railroad companies to meet
their pay-rolls oftener, once each month is generally recognized as
pay-time, and on large roads it would be simply out of the question
for the pay-rolls to be made up correctly and the men paid off
sooner. The paymaster is the wage-distributing medium, and by
virtue of his generosity will command as much respect as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
President of the road. No officer's face is more familiar than his,
and surely no one connected with the institution is looked for with
more eagerness by the hard-working employees. It is no easy
task he has to perform, and the responsibility for the millions of
dollars paid out in this way annually is very great. This responsibility,
however, has been very much reduced on some roads,
where wages are paid by checks entirely. Under some circumstances
this system will not work satisfactorily, especially on a road
running through a sparsely settled country. The employees may
have to stand a good round discount to some store-keeper or
tradesman in order to secure their money. The best and most
satisfactory return for services can be nothing less than solid cash;
it encourages better attention to business and relieves the men
from possible annoyance and inconvenience. The Paymaster's
car, which is virtually a moving bank or cashier's office, and arranged
conveniently for the payment of money to the men as they
pass through, is generally run "special," upon notice in advance
to all foremen or heads of departments, either by telegraph or, as
on some roads, by the display of special signal flags, which are carried
on the front end of the locomotive of some regular train the
day before the car is run over any division. In this way all men
employed along the line of the road, whether at or between stations,
are notified of the Paymaster's coming, and it does not usually
require any other inducement than this to bring them all out.
There is nothing that will prompt them to jump higher and run
faster than the whistle of the pay-train as it comes around the
curve to the station. Men have been known to forget their names,
and do other foolish things under the excitement of drawing their
month's pay. The fellow who said he could not write all his name
when requested by the Paymaster to sign the pay-roll, but offered
to write as much of it as he could, after some deliberation made a
cross on the sheet with all the care and nicety he could muster.
Others who could not write have been very slow to admit it, and
have pleaded haste as an excuse for not doing so. So far as Italians
are concerned (and what railroad service is now complete without
its gang of Italian laborers?), they are usually designated by numbers,
and in some cases their foremen have thought it well to name
them after prominent statesmen or other public men, or possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
some of the head officials of the company. To run across twenty-five
or thirty Daniel Websters on the same road is not surprising,
and the President of the company himself is liable to have a half-dozen
namesakes throughout the different divisions of his road. A
cage of jabbering monkeys is not a more amusing spectacle than
some gangs of Italian laborers receiving their month's pay.</p>

<p>The pay-department can be made very systematic, and to promote
economy and accuracy it is absolutely necessary that it should
be. The Paymaster is not simply a medium through whom wages
are distributed. He may be one of the most important officers of his
company, and ferret out frauds and dishonesty which otherwise might
never be discovered. He knows all the men, and they, of course,
know him. In fact, he is the only one connected with the road
whose recognition among all the employees is absolutely certain.</p>

<p>Some idea of the enormous amount of money earned annually
by the railroad men in this country may be formed from the statement
that it requires about $1,000,000 per month to pay twenty
thousand men, and there are a good many roads on which the
average monthly pay-roll embraces from fifteen thousand to twenty
thousand names; in some cases even more.</p>

<p>When the pay-rolls are all turned over to the Paymaster, properly
approved by each head of department, he notifies the Superintendent
or Trainmaster of his proposed trip, mapping out in detail
the route, which is usually the same each month. The signals
or telegrams are sent ahead to the various foremen, and the car is
ordered ready for the journey. The funds are arranged in denominations
to suit the circumstances, with plenty of small change,
and enough money for a day or two only at a time is provided.
The pay for the flagmen at crossings, and switchmen on the road,
as well as for the agents at small stations, is generally done up in
envelopes, and, as the train speeds by, the packages are handed or
thrown out at the proper places; and sometimes, to warrant a safe
delivery, a forked stick is used, into which the envelope is put, thus
giving it plenty of weight and saving it from being tumbled about
promiscuously on the ground. Much time is saved in this way, and
the pay-train is able to keep well out of the way of any regular
train which may be following. So the pay-car flies along, only
stopping at some large station where the number of employees engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
is sufficient to warrant it. These are quickly paid off, however,
and the journey is continued. Perhaps at some junction a
freight crew is met; and as these fellows have to get their money
when they can, a stop is made on the road to give them a chance
to do it. At some stations are found two or three gangs of section
or track men, a watchman, an agent and his assistant, a pumper,
and possibly a mail-carrier. Perhaps a discharged trainman will
turn up also, who may have part of a month's pay coming to him.</p>

<p>Later in the day it may be a shop gang of five hundred or one
thousand men, consisting of carpenters, painters, machinists, and
boiler-makers, and these are paid in order, each set of men by itself.
There is no noise or disturbance, everything goes like clock-work,
as all pass through in regular order, each gang or class preceded
by its foreman, and the men arranged in line in the order in
which their names appear on the pay-rolls. When night comes,
and two or three hundred miles of road have been covered, the
balance of the funds is carefully locked up in the safe on board, the
car run in upon some convenient siding, and the engine housed for
a wiping and a thorough preparation for the next day's run. The
car is generally provided with comfortable beds for the Paymaster
and his clerks, and during the paying-off time they practically live
in the car. This insures early starts in the morning, and on large
roads the necessity for haste is very apparent, where possibly two
or three weeks are consumed each month in paying off the rolls.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The average traveller, spinning across the country at forty
miles an hour, is not apt to think of the countless details involved
in the make-up of the train in which he rides or the track over
which he is wheeled; but when he considers how safely the millions
of passengers are annually carried over the one hundred and
fifty thousand miles or more of railroad in this country alone, he
may be brought to realize that quite as much depends upon the
quality of the material entering into the construction of the train
and tracks as upon the efficiency of the engineer in the cab, or the
conductor, brakeman, switchmen, and train-despatcher who perform
their respective responsible duties in connection therewith.
Feeding a railroad, then, means a great deal more than the majority
of mankind supposes.</p>

<p class="drop-cap1">At the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia, in the
Post-Office exhibit, was a double picture showing
the postal service at the beginning of the century
and as it is to-day. On one side was a postman&mdash;perhaps
Franklin&mdash;on horseback, jogging over
a corduroy road, "through the forest primeval,"
making a mile or two an hour; and on the other
a representation of the fast mail train, the "catcher"
taking a pouch from the "crane" as it passes at the rate of fifty
miles an hour! Standing in the foreground is the pretty daughter
of the village postmaster with the mail pouch just thrown from the
car in her hand, a group of rustics, with ill-concealed admiration
in their eyes, watching her as the swiftly passing train goes on its
journey. This picture is not, perhaps, a work of art, but it is an
"object lesson," giving at a glance the progress that our country
has made in a hundred years.</p>

</div>

<p>Of all the executive departments of the Government, the Post-Office
is the one nearest the people, and the one with which they
are the most familiar. In addition to its work of collecting, transporting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
and delivering legitimate mail matter, viz., letters, newspapers,
and magazines, it is the greatest express company of the
continent, since it has
an office at almost every
cross-roads, even
carrying merchandise
cheaper (considering
the distance) than its
rivals. Its registration
system affords a
means of forwarding
valuable packages, at
a slight additional
cost, with almost absolute
security. It is
the greatest banking
institution on this side
of the Atlantic. The
transactions of its
money-order system,
not only in our own
country, but with almost
every nation in
the civilized world
(Russia and Spain excepted), run up to wellnigh fabulous sums.
Its drafts are easily obtained and cheap. Its notes are "gilt
edged," and have never been repudiated. With the creation of
the Postal Savings Bank system, the working people's department
in its organization will approach perfection.</p>

<p>The first mention of a travelling post-office occurs in a memorial
addressed to Congress in November, 1776, by Ebenezer
Hazard, Postmaster-General under the Continental Congress, in
which he states that, owing to the frequent removals of the Continental
Army, he was subjected to extraordinary expense, difficulties,
and fatigues, "having paid an exorbitant price for every
necessary of life, and having been obliged, for want of a horse&mdash;which
could not be procured&mdash;to follow the army on foot."</p>

<p>Directly after the inauguration of General Washington, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
April, 1789, the organization of the Post-Office Department followed,
and Samuel Osgood, of Massachusetts, was appointed
Postmaster-General. That the people might derive the greatest
possible advantage from an institution peculiarly their own, this
gigantic monopoly&mdash;for it is nothing else&mdash;was created, and all
competition forbidden. The Postmaster-General had then but one
clerk, and there were but 75 post-offices and 1,875 miles of post-roads
in the United States; the cost of mail transportation being
$22,081, the total revenue, $37,935, the total expenditures, $32,140;
leaving a surplus of $5,795. From this time until 1836 the
contracts made for the transportation of the mails do not mention
any kind of service on post-roads except stages, sulkies, four-horse
post-coaches, horseback, packets, and steam-boats.</p>

<p>The growth of the Railway Mail Service has been coincident
with that of the railway itself, and the importance of both cannot
be underestimated in considering the future development of the
country. Almost as soon as a railroad is fully organized it becomes
a mail contractor with the Department.</p>

<p>The Act of Congress constituting every railroad in the United
States a post-route was approved July 7, 1838. Postmaster-General
Barry, in his annual report for 1836, speaks of the multiplication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
of railroads in many parts of the country, and suggests it
as a subject worthy of inquiry, whether measures may not be taken
to secure the transportation of the mail on them, and adds: "Already
have the railroads between Frenchtown, in Maryland, and
Newcastle, in Delaware, and between Camden and South Amboy,
in New Jersey, afforded great and important facilities to the transmission
of the great eastern mail." At this time a railroad between
Washington and New York was in process of construction,
and Postmaster-General Barry dwelt in his report on the importance
of the facilities that would be afforded for speedy service between
the two cities, predicting that the run between them would
probably be made in sixteen hours. The service is now performed
in about five hours.</p>

<div class="caption">The Overland Mail Coach&mdash;A Star Route.</div>
</div>

<p>At first the facilities for mail services were very limited. Postmaster-General
Kendall, in 1835, suggested that the Baltimore &amp;
Ohio Railroad Company might be asked to close in some portion
of their baggage-cars, a strong lock being placed on the apartment,
to which only the postmasters at Washington and Baltimore should
have keys. In the same report he adds: "If wheels can be constructed
which can be used alike upon the railroads and the streets
of the cities respectively, the Department will furnish an entire car
containing the mail to be delivered at one depot, and received at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
the other, asking nothing of the company but to haul it." It was
even proposed at this time that the Government should have its
own locomotives, everything else on the road giving the right of
way to the mail train. This proposition was not adopted. The
fear was expressed,
however, that
if the Department
did not have absolute
control
over the road,
the people would
have to depend
on stage or other
horse transportation
for mail service.
All these
early troubles in
time passed away,
and, through concessions
on both sides, the railways soon became the most important
agent of the Post-Office Department.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<div class="caption">Mail Carrying in the Country.</div>
</div>

<p>This, of course, was not accomplished without many trials and
tribulations. It seems strange, in the light of the present, to read
in an official report a remonstrance from route agents that nearly
every night dead bodies were placed in the mail crates between
Philadelphia and New York, and the mails packed around the
coffins. This breach of good order disappeared after that time,
and with it came to an end the freight methods and the old stage-coach
ideas of dealing with the mails.</p>

<p>A separate compartment in a baggage-car, fitted up with few
conveniences necessary for the distribution of local way-mail, was
the beginning of the system which has developed into the luxurious
postal cars of the present time. As a matter of history, however,
it is only fair to say that the system which we then adopted
had been in use for some time by our northern neighbors of
Canada, who had taken it from the mother country.</p>

<p>The credit of suggesting the first step toward the present system
has generally been given to Colonel G. B. Armstrong, who in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
1864 was Assistant Postmaster at Chicago. This is incorrect;
Mr. W. A. Davis, a clerk of the St. Joseph, Mo., Post-Office,
where the overland mail was made up, conceived the idea, in 1862,
that if the letters and papers could be assorted on the cars between
Quincy and St. Joseph, the overland mail could start promptly on
time. He was given permission to carry out this idea, and there
are vouchers on file in the Department at Washington showing
that he was paid for that specific work. In 1864 Colonel Armstrong
was authorized and encouraged by the Hon. Montgomery
Blair, then Postmaster-General, to undertake the difficult task of
arranging and introducing the service. On August 31, 1864, he
wrote: "To-day I commenced the new distribution." Subsequently,
Colonel Armstrong became the first General Railway Mail
Superintendent, and held this office until ill-health compelled him
to resign, in 1871. To Colonel George S. Bangs, of Illinois, and
his successors, Theodore N. Vail, William B. Thompson, and
John Jameson, is due the excellence of the present system. Colonel
Bangs was a thoroughly equipped post-office man, energetic,
courageous, and progressive. Brimful of ideas, he was ever on
the lookout for improvement. Never satisfied with old ways, he
was constantly striving to simplify and better the service. He forgot
himself in his work, and died a martyr to his duty, leaving the
Travelling Post-Office of to-day a monument to his memory.
While to Colonel Armstrong is due the credit for the skeleton of
the system, it was the genius of Colonel Bangs that clothed the
bones with flesh, developed the sinew, put the blood in circulation,
and breathed into its body the breath of life. Colonel Bangs
found, in 1871, that everything was disjointed, disconnected, and
sluggish. There was no attempt at "certainty, security, or celerity."
It was a "go-as-you-please" condition of affairs. He grappled
at once with it and brought order out of chaos. He introduced
a system of emulation among the employees, rewarding
those who displayed proficiency by promotion over the sluggish,
and thus, in fact, was probably the father of what is now known as
Civil Service Reform. In 1874 he discussed the propriety of establishing
a fast and exclusive mail train between New York and
Chicago, "this train" (quoting his report to the Postmaster-General)
"to be under the control of the Department, so far as it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
necessary for the purposes designed, and to run the distance in
about twenty-four hours. It is conceded by railway officials that
this can be done. The importance of a line like this cannot be
overestimated. It would reduce the actual time of mail between
the east and west from twelve to twenty-four hours. As it would
necessarily be established upon one or more of the trunk lines,
having an extended system of connections, its benefit would be
in no case confined, but extended through all parts of the country
alike."</p>

<p>This report met with the approval of Postmaster-General Jewell,
who ordered Bangs to negotiate with the New York Central
&amp; Hudson River Railroad and the Lake Shore Railroad for a fast
mail train, leaving New York at four o'clock in the morning, and
arriving at Chicago in about twenty-four hours. It was the old
story of making bricks without straw. The Post-Office Department
had no appropriation to pay for such facilities, hence it had
to depend at first on the public spirit of the railroad authorities.
Commodore Vanderbilt, the president of the companies whose
lines were to be used, had had dealings with the Department, and
was perhaps not altogether sanguine as to the practical issue of
the experiment, or in respect to the countenance it would receive
from Congress; but Mr. William H. Vanderbilt, the vice-president,
lent a willing ear to Mr. Bangs's proposition, and did his utmost
to aid him in putting it into effect. There being no special
appropriation available for the purpose in hand, "the devil was
whipped around the stump" by Colonel Bangs stipulating that if
Mr. Vanderbilt would have twenty cars built and the service performed,
all matter originating at or coming into the New York
Post-Office, which could reach its destination at the same time by
this line, should be sent by this train, and that the railway companies
could have the right to demand a weighing of the mail matter
at will, all railroads being paid according to weight. When
the details of the plan were communicated to Commodore Vanderbilt,
he is reported to have said to his son: "If you want to do this,
go ahead, but I know the Post-Office Department, and you will,
too, within a year." Mr. Vanderbilt did "go ahead." He constructed
and equipped the finest mail train ever seen on the planet,
ran it for ten months, never missed a connection at Chicago, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
was always on time at New York. He did not have to wait a
year, however, for a realization of the sagacious old commodore's
prophecy. Within three weeks, despite the indignant protest of
Colonel Bangs, the mails of three States were ordered to be taken
from this and given to another route. A grosser and more wanton
breach of plighted faith it would be hard to find, and its results
were far-reaching and disastrous.</p>

<p>This train was a marvel of completeness and efficiency. It was
manned by picked men, and the only complaint ever made against
it was that it ran so fast that the clerks had not time to sort the
mails for the post-offices between New York and Poughkeepsie.
To obviate this, Colonel Bangs requested the postmaster at New
York to have two hundred mail-bags dyed red, which should contain
the mail for those offices nearest together, so that the crew in
the train could distribute them first. There was no complaint after
that. But when the dyer's bill was sent by the postmaster to the
Department, it was disallowed by a clerk of the Second Assistant
Postmaster-General, who, in a letter announcing the fact, said that
there was no necessity for the outlay if the postal clerks did their
duty. Bangs, who had just arrived at the post-office from a day
and night's ride on his favorite train, was lying on a sofa half
asleep in the postmaster's private office, as that official was opening
his mail. When he came to that letter he handed it to Bangs.
He was wide-awake in an instant. "Mr. Postmaster," said he,
"do you know the man who signed this letter? He is a wheezy
priest, a fool, and a Baptist, at that. Give me the letter." The
bill was allowed as soon as Bangs reached the Department. He
was wrong, however, in crediting the subordinate to the Baptist
faith. He was an ornament of another persuasion.</p>

<p>So carefully had the project been considered and adapted that
the service on the Central, from the start, moved with the precision
of clock-work, and was an immediate success. It is proper to
say that word of what was going on between the Department and
the Vanderbilt system reached the Hon. Thomas A. Scott, President
of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and he at once made up his
mind that the corporation under his management could not afford
to be behind its great rival. One Saturday morning he telegraphed
to J. D. Layng (now General Manager of the West Shore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
and President of the C. C. C. &amp; I.), then General Manager of the
Pennsylvania lines west of Pittsburg, to know if by the following
Monday week, the date on which the train was to start, four postal
cars could be built and the first one be in Chicago ready to start
on its eastern trip. The answer came back, "Yes." The order
was given to the Allegheny shops on Saturday afternoon, and on
the following Saturday the first of the cars, complete and equipped
for mail service, started for Chicago, and began its east-bound trip
on Monday morning. The second and third cars were finished on
Monday night, and the fourth&mdash;thus fully equipping the line&mdash;on
Tuesday.</p>

<p>Thus had been established two splendid fast trains, and the
outlook was bright for the future, when Congress, in spite of the
efforts of the Post-Office Department, passed an Act reducing
the already inadequate compensation to the trunk lines, for the
carrying of the mails. This action brought official notice from
Messrs. Vanderbilt and Scott of the discontinuance of the fast mail
trains between New York City and Chicago, and that service
ended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span><br />

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">At a Way-station&mdash;The Postmaster's Assistant.</div>
</div>

<p>Colonel Bangs was greatly mortified at this result, but he stood
his ground and remained at his post until the close of the year.
Then, worn out with never-ending toil, and disheartened by the
action of Congress, he tendered his resignation and insisted on its
acceptance. Parted from the Post-Office, President Grant, knowing
his worth and wishing to recognize his services, appointed him
Assistant Treasurer of the United States at Chicago. He lived to
perform the duties of this office only a few months, as death overtook
him suddenly, while on a visit to Washington on official business,
December, 1876. His work, however, was not permitted to
drop. He had left in the service three assistants, Theodore N. Vail,
William B. Thompson&mdash;afterward Second Assistant Postmaster-General&mdash;and
John Jameson, who were fully imbued with the ideas
of their late chief and were fully loyal to them. They, in the order
named, became his successors, and never permitted opportunities
to escape wherein there was a possible benefit to the service to be
secured. Although the fast mail service was suspended for lack of
support from Congress, its usefulness and practicability had been
so thoroughly demonstrated that an appropriation of $150,000 was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
made in March, 1877, for its resumption on the trunk lines. This
victory was not reached without untiring efforts on the part of Mr.
Vail, and by generous support in both houses of Congress; in the
Senate by the Hon. Hannibal Hamlin and James G. Blaine, of
Maine, and in the House of Representatives by such broad and
liberal statesmen as Mr. Waddell, of North Carolina, Mr. Randall,
of Pennsylvania, and Mr. Cox, of New York.</p>

<p>Since then, Messrs. Thompson and Jameson have watched the
progress of the work with jealous eyes, and have succeeded in extending
it practically to the whole country. The present service
is due not alone to the liberality of Congress, because the appropriations
have been parsimonious, but to the generosity of the railways,
which have performed a valuable work for a price which in
many cases does not pay the expense of the necessary additional
labor involved.</p>

<p>The Railway Mail Service at the close of the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1888, gave employment to 5,094 clerks. Matter was distributed
on 126,310 miles of railway, and on 17,402 miles additional
closed pouches were carried. There were also operated 41 inland
steam-boat lines on which postal clerks were employed. The
postal clerks travelled (in crews) 122,031,104 miles by railway, and
1,767,649 miles by steam-boats. They distributed 6,528,772,060
pieces of ordinary mail matter, and handled 16,001,059 registered
packages and cases, and 1,103,083 through registered pouches and
inner registered sacks. The service is in charge of one General
Superintendent, who has his headquarters at Washington, and it
is divided into eleven divisions with a superintendent in charge of
each.</p>

<p>The majority of people who travel on railways (and how many
Americans are there who do not?) have paid passing attention to
the railway mail cars as they have stood at the station preparatory
to the starting of the train, and have glanced through the open
doors with more or less curiosity at the scene of energy and bustle
witnessed within. At such a moment, no matter how great the
curiosity, it is not feasible to investigate closely, for the workers
must not be hampered by the prying public, however praiseworthy
the motive. To supply this pardonable desire to know how it is
done, I invite my readers to accompany me in spirit on a visit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the Grand Central Station, to witness the preparations for the departure
of train No. 11, known in railway parlance as "the New
York and Chicago Fast Mail," which leaves New York every night
at nine o'clock.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_324.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Loading for the Fast Mail, at the General Post-Office, New York.</div>
</div>

<p>It must not be supposed that everything has been left until the
last moment, and that the mail matter has been tumbled into the
cars on the eve of departure, to be handled as best it may in the
short run to Albany; for under such conditions the task would be
an impossibility even to an army of trained hands. Work has
been in progress since four o'clock in the afternoon, and it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
been steady, hard labor every minute of the time. The five cars
have been backed down to the tracks opposite Forty-fifth Street,
and have been so placed that they are convenient of access to the
big lumbering mail wagons which are familiar sights in the streets
of the metropolis. The crew of nineteen men, skilled in the handling
of mail matter, and thorough experts in the geography of the
country, reported to the chief clerk and took up their stations in
the various cars at the hour named. At the same time the wagons
began arriving from the General Post-Office with their tons of matter
which had "originated" in New York, and were soon transferring
their loads to the cars, where agile hands were in waiting
to receive them. Since the removal of the deadly stoves from the
railway trains the occupants of the postal cars have suffered to no
small extent owing to the lack of heat. These cars are provided
with steam-heating apparatus which is worked from the engine,
but they are occupied for five hours before the engine comes near
them, and in cold weather the hands of the men employed in distributing
letters become numb with cold. This is a matter which
should receive prompt attention.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_326.jpg" width="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">At the Last Moment.</div>
</div>

<p>Before we deal with the mail matter, let us look at the cars and
the men who occupy them. The train, as it leaves New York, is
made up of five cars which are placed immediately behind the engine,
and are followed by express and baggage cars and one passenger
coach. The car next to the engine is devoted entirely to
letter mail, and the four following it to papers and packages. The
letter car is fifty feet in length, while those for the newspaper mail
are ten feet longer. All are uniform in width, nine feet eight
inches, and are six feet nine inches high in the clear. When newly
built, before long and hard service had told on their appearance,
their outsides were white in color, with cream-tinted borderings and
gilt ornamentations, and were highly varnished. Midway on the
outside, and below; the windows of each car, is a large oval gilt-finished
frame within which is painted the name of the car, with
the words, "United States Post Office" above and below. The
cars used by the New York Central are named for the Governors
of the State and the members of President Garfield's cabinet.
Along the upper edge and centre are painted in large gilt letters
the words, "The Fast Mail Train," while on a line with these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
letters at the other end, in a square, are the words, in like lettering,
"New York Central" and "Lake Shore." The frieze and minute
trimmings around the windows are of gilt finish. The body of
the car also contains other ornamentation, including the coat-of-arms
of the United States. The running gear is of the most approved
pattern. The platforms are enclosed by swinging doors
which, when opened, afford a protected passage between the cars.
This arrangement no doubt suggested the modern improvement
now known as the vestibuled train. The letter car is provided with
a "mail catcher," which is placed at a small door through which
mail pouches are snatched from conveniently placed posts at wayside
stations where stops are not made. Each car is divided into
three sections, all fitted up alike with conveniences for the service
to be performed. The letter car, however, is somewhat differently
arranged from the others, to meet the requirements of that particular
branch of the work.</p>

<div class="caption">Pouching the Mail in the Postal Car.</div>
</div>

<p>In the first section of the letter car are received the pouches
from the General Post-Office, which when opened are found to contain
letters done up in packages of about a hundred, marked for
Michigan, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, Montana,
Dakota, and California. When this mass of matter has been
emptied out of the pouches and, in the vernacular of the service,
"dumped up" preparatory to distribution, the section is clear for
the registered mail which is worked in it. Before this is accomplished,
however, much work is done; in fact, a sort of rough distribution
is made. All packages which are directed to one office
are distributed into pouches, which are afterward stored away until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
the towns are reached. The other packages are carried into the
letter department for distribution, where a rack, similar to those
seen in almost every post-office, although space is thoroughly
economized, is used for the purpose. To give a slight idea of the
work done in this section, it may be mentioned that the distribution
for New York State alone requires 325 boxes. Still there is
plenty of space, otherwise the third section of the car would not
be used, as it is, for the distribution of Montana and Dakota newspapers.
How closely everything is packed, and all available space
utilized, may be imagined when it is stated that for this newspaper
mail ninety-five pouches are hung in the section, and that there is
still sufficient room for the storage of pouches locked up and ready
for delivery, and also for the sealed registered mail. A separation
of the California mail is also made in this car, so that when it
reaches Chicago the pouches into which the matter is placed are
transferred without delay, thus saving twenty-four hours on the
time to the Pacific Coast, not by any means an unimportant accomplishment.</p>

<p>There have been received in this car before it moves out of
the Grand Central Station between 1,000 and 1,500 packages of
letters and, in addition, forty or fifty sacks of Dakota and Montana
papers. To handle this mass of correspondence there are six men
in addition to the chief clerk, or superintendent. This official is
not assigned to any particular duty, but he supervises the general
work and lends aid where it is most required. The second clerk
handles letters for Ohio, Dakota, and Montana; the third clerk
takes charge of those for New York State; the fourth, Illinois; the
fifth opens all pouches labelled, "New York and Chicago Railway
Post-Office," distributes their contents, and afterward works
on Dakota and Montana papers; the sixth, Michigan State letters,
and the seventh, California letter mail. The salaries of these
men, intrusted with so much responsibility and of whom so much
is expected, range from $900 per annum for the lowest grade to
$1,300 per annum for the superintendent.</p>

<p>The second, or "Illinois Car," is devoted, as are the others
which follow it, to the newspaper and periodical mail. In it are
handled papers for Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, New York, Oregon,
and Wyoming. Two clerks and two assistants man this car. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
first assistant, who "faces up" papers ready to be distributed,
draws mails from stalls to case, and removes boxes as fast as they
are filled, has gained the sobriquet of the "Illinois derrick," owing
to the heavy nature of his duties. The second, who lends
what aid he can in the heavy work on the run between New York
and Albany, has become known on the train as "the short stop."
The third section of the car is used for storing the bags of assorted
matter.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>The third car is used for storing through mail for San Francisco,
Omaha, and points west of Chicago. In it are also carried
stamped envelopes from the manufacturer at Hartford, Conn., to
postmasters in the West. This car is frequently fully loaded with
matter from the New York office when the journey is begun, and
it is then found necessary to add a similar car to the train on its
arrival at Albany for the accommodation of matter taken on by the
way and bound for the same destination.</p>

<p>The Michigan paper car is the fourth. In it are handled papers
for Michigan, Iowa, and the mixed Western States. In the first
section are piled the Iowa pouches and those for points out of
Utica, which have been distributed in the centre section, and in
the third section the distribution for Michigan, Nebraska, and
Minnesota, as well as for points reached from Buffalo, is made.

<p>The fifth, or California paper car, is the last mail coach on the
train, as it is made up when leaving the Grand Central Station.
Besides the papers for the Golden State the car carries through
registered pouches to Chicago
and the West, which
have been made up in the
New York office, and, as a
usual thing, a large lot of
stamped envelopes for postmasters
in the West. The
California letter man from the
first car looks after the papers
for the same State, and has
an eye to the safety of the
car. On reaching Albany
another car is added to the
train, making six in all from
that point. This last addition
comes from Boston,
brings the morning mail from
Bangor, Me., and is manned
by four men.</p>

<p>The run to Chicago for
post-office purposes is divided
into three divisions: from New York to Syracuse, from Syracuse to
Cleveland, and from Cleveland to Chicago. Each division has its
own crew, so that the men leaving New York are relieved at Syracuse
by others, and these in turn at Cleveland. The New York
crew go to work, as has been said, at 4 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span>, and if the train is on
time at Syracuse, as it usually is, they arrive there at 5.35 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>,
after thirteen and a half hours of as hard work as men are called
upon to do. The same evening at 8.40 they relieve the east-bound
crew, and are in New York again at six o'clock on the following
morning. Half an hour later they are to be found on the top
floor of the General Post-Office building, comfortably ensconced
in bunks and in a large and airy room, provided as a dormitory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
for their use by the postmaster of New York at the time of
the inauguration of the fast mail service. Each crew makes
three round trips and is then laid off for six days, but its members
are all this time subject to extra duty, which they are called
upon to perform with unpleasant frequency, particularly in holiday
times.</p>

<p>After leaving New York, the first stop the train makes is at
Poughkeepsie, but no mail is taken on there. At Albany the second
halt is made, and there twenty minutes are spent in taking on
the mail from New England and northeastern New York. At
Palatine Bridge there is a brief stop, and after that comes Utica,
where the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western, the Ontario &amp;
Western, and the Rome, Watertown &amp; Ogdensburg roads exchange
mail matter. At Syracuse more mails come, this time from
the Oswego, Binghamton &amp; Syracuse, and the Auburn &amp; Rochester
branch of the New York Central. Here also comes welcome
relief for the crew which left New York. Those who follow have
much to keep them busy, but the heaviest part of the work has
been already performed.</p>

<p>From Syracuse to Cleveland there are several distributing
points where mail matter is also received on the train, and the
routine is continued much as already described until the crew is
relieved at Cleveland. There the men of the Western Division
take charge and continue the work until Elkhart, Ind., is reached.
There a special force from Chicago meets the train, takes possession
of a portion of the letter car, and makes the distribution for
the main office and stations of the city of Chicago, thus saving
much time. When the train arrives in Chicago, it makes connection
with a fast mail train on the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy, as
also on a like train on the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul. The
former train arrives at Council Bluffs about 7 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span>, and there overtakes
the train which left Chicago on the previous evening. The
Pacific Coast mail is thus expedited just twenty-four hours. A
similar train on the St. Paul road also saves twenty-four hours' time
on the trip to the northwestern portion of the Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>The appropriation for special facilities for the year ending June
30, 1889, was $295,987.53. The uses to which the appropriation
referred to is put are explained in the following table.</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>A careful perusal of this table develops the fact that the greater
portion of this money is expended south of Philadelphia, the railroad
companies in that section not having sufficient weight of mails
to warrant fast trains without some additional compensation. It
will also be noted that with the exception of the sum of $25,000
for a special train to Poughkeepsie, which leaves New York City
at 4.35 in the morning, the New York Central receives no compensation
except that earned by them as common carriers of so many
pounds of freight-mail matter carried, being paid for in accordance
with its weight. It will also be observed that the Pennsylvania
Railroad, on its trunk line, is not even so fortunate as its great rival.</p>

<p>There may be more dangerous pursuits in life than that of the
railway post-office clerk, but there are not many so, and there are
few in which the risk to life and limb is so constant. The everyday
citizen who is called upon occasionally to make a railroad
journey of a few hundred miles feels it to be incumbent upon himself
on such occasions to make special provision for those dependent
on him in case injury or death should come while riding in
the thoroughly appointed and luxurious coach placed in a portion
of the train least likely to suffer from accident. But too little
thought is devoted to the safety of those poorly paid but efficient
servants of the State, in the forward cars, without whose services
the business of the country, as conducted to-day, would come to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
stand-still. To show that the importance of this service is not here
exaggerated, it is only necessary to recall the condition of affairs
in New York City, and other cities as well, in March, 1888, when
the great blizzard fell upon the land. There were then no mails
for several days, and the prostration which came upon the community
is too well remembered to need comment. The danger to
those within the postal cars, however, is recognized by the railway
people, and efforts have been made in the way of providing safety
appliances, but it is, of course, impossible to lessen the danger to
any great extent. All that American ingenuity suggests in the
way of construction, both inside and outside of the cars, is provided.
The body of the car is most substantially built, the platforms
and couplings are of the most approved patterns, the trucks
are similar to those used under the best passenger coaches, and
the air-brakes and other safety apparatus are all brought into requisition.
Within the cars are saws, axes, hammers, and crowbars
conveniently placed in case of wreck, and safety-bars extend the
length of the cars overhead to which the clerks may cling when the
cars leave the track and roll down embankments, as they often do.
In the year ending June, 1888, there were 248 accidents to trains
upon which postal clerks were employed. In these wrecks four
clerks were killed; sixty-three were seriously, several of the number
permanently, and forty-five slightly injured. The official report of
the accidents shows that the majority of them resulted from collisions,
while others were due to the spreading of the rails, the failure
of air-brakes to work at critical moments, and obstructions on
the track.</p>

<p>In every case where cars were wrecked the postal car was
among the number.</p>

<p>In many instances the cars were telescoped, and on such occasions
the clerks were found buried in the wreckage or pinned
under the engine or its tender. And many times true heroism was
shown by the injured men. Over and over again the General
Superintendent reports that, notwithstanding severe injuries received
by the clerks, the scattered mail matter was collected by
them and transferred either to another train or to the nearest post-office.
Several times trains in the West were held up by robbers,
who, after sacking the express car, visited the postal car, introducing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
themselves with pistol-shots. One clerk was seriously wounded
in the shoulder. An instance of self-possession is reported
in Arkansas, where the robbers, before visiting the postal car, had
secured $10,000
from the
express safe.
When they
came to clerk
R. P. Johnson
he suggested
that they had
secured booty
enough, and
that under the
circumstances
they might let
the mail matter
alone. The
masked men
agreed with
him, and did
not molest the
mails.</p>

<p>In view of
the dangers to
which employees of the
Railway Mail Service are
exposed, it may be permitted
to quote from the last annual report
of General Superintendent
Bancroft on the subject of insurance.
No action, he points out,
has ever been taken by Congress
toward providing for the care of clerks permanently injured in the
service, or those dependent upon them in case of death, notwithstanding
frequent recommendations by the Department. He
attributes this to insurmountable objections on the part of the
people's representatives to the creation of anything of the nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
of a civil pension-roll. He therefore suggests that there shall be
deducted from the pay of each and every railway postal clerk ten
cents per month, to be paid into "The Railway Postal Clerks' Insurance
Fund," the custodian of which is to be the United States
Treasury. In case of death from injuries while on duty, $1,000 is
to be paid to the clerk's heirs. While this proposition is in the
right direction, it hardly goes far enough. Provision should be
made for the disabled, and to do so, the clerks doubtless would
not object to an assessment of double the amount suggested. That
they should be compelled to resort to such a mode of relief, however,
is a reflection upon the Government of the United States.</p>

<p>The first great need of the Railway Mail Service is an adequate
appropriation by Congress to extend its usefulness, and to keep it
up to the demands and the needs of the public. Where speed is required
to make connections, the Department should have the cash
on hand to buy what is necessary. The railways are business institutions,
managed as such, and when the Department desires extra
facilities it should be prepared to pay in coin and not in talk. In
this connection it is a pleasant duty for the writer of this very imperfect
sketch to say that during his term of service in the post-office
at New York, and at the Department, he always found Mr. William
H. Vanderbilt, Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt, Mr. J. H. Rutter, of
the New York Central; Mr. John Newell, of the Lake Shore; Mr.
George B. Roberts, Mr. A. J. Cassatt, and Mr. Frank Thomson, of
the Pennsylvania system; Mr. R. R. Bridgers and Mr. H. B. Plant,
of the Atlantic Coast Line, ready to grant any reasonable request
for the improvement and extension of the service. Time after time
Mr. Roberts has run a special train with the Australian transcontinental
mail from Pittsburg to New York, that it might catch an
outgoing steamer; and he and Mr. Vanderbilt practically re-established
the fast mail, by taking letters on their limited trains. Mr.
Roberts gave, in addition, an extra mail train from Philadelphia
west at four o'clock in the morning, and Mr. Vanderbilt placed a
postal car on the 4 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> train from New York, receiving in return&mdash;what
they had a right to demand&mdash;an extra weighing of the
mails, and, what was not a matter of surprise to them, unmeasured
abuse on the floor of Congress for giving these additional facilities
to the people of the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>The last and greatest need of the postal service is the total
and complete elimination of partisan considerations as affecting appointments
and removals in the working force. The spoils method
invariably brings into the service a lot of do-nothings or a race of
experimenters, whose performances never fail to breed disaster
and to crush out substantial progress.</p>

<p>There is no position in the Government more exacting than that
of a postal clerk, and none that has so many requirements. He
must not only be sound "in wind and limb," but possessed of more
than ordinary intelligence, and a retentive memory. His work is
constant, and his only recreation, study. He must not only be proficient
in his own immediate work, but he must have a general
knowledge of the entire country, so that the correspondence he
handles shall reach its destination at the earliest possible moment.
He must know no night and no day. He must be impervious
to heat or cold. Rushing along at a rate of forty or fifty
miles an hour, in charge of that which is sacred&mdash;the correspondence
of the people&mdash;catching his meals as he may; at home only
semi-occasionally, the wonder is that men competent to discharge
the duties of so high a calling can be found for so small a compensation,
and for so uncertain a tenure of official life. They have
not only to take the extra-hazardous risks of their toilsome duties,
but they are at the mercy of the practical politicians who believe
that "to the victor belong the spoils." There are no public offices
which are so emphatically "public trusts" as those whose duties
comprise that of handling the correspondence of the people, because
upon the proper and skilful performance of that duty depend&mdash;to
a far greater degree than in the care of any other function
accomplished through government agency&mdash;the business and social
welfare of the entire community. The effects of ignorance,
carelessness, and dishonesty in any other branch of the public
service, although to be deplored, are not to be compared to those
which follow the existence of such evils in the Post-Office. Can
there be a more flagrant abuse of a "public trust" than the perversion
of a branch of the public service into an agency for furthering
the ambitious ends of local politicians and their partisans by
allowing them to distribute its "patronage" as rewards for party
services among those who, by reason of inexperience&mdash;if for no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
graver cause&mdash;are incompetent to replace the skilled workman who
must be routed out in order to give them room? This evil should
be corrected at once. The Railway Mail Service must no longer
be left at the mercy of the local partisans. The reform is not only
a present necessity, but it was one in the past and will be in the
future, until the force of public sentiment shall compel acquiescence
in the reasonable demand that what was so eminently meant for
mankind shall not be given up to party; that the non-political
business of letter-carrying, which the Government has monopolized,
shall be conducted by it solely with a view to prompt and
expeditious carrying of mail matter, and not with the object of
bolstering up local "statesmen" or carrying elections.</p>

<p>At the coming in of Mr. Cleveland's administration, William B.
Thompson was Second Assistant Postmaster-General&mdash;in charge
of the contract office&mdash;and John Jameson was General Railway
Mail Superintendent. Both of these gentlemen had worked their
way from the ranks by sheer merit. In private business the value
of their services would have been so highly appreciated that, no
matter who became senior partner of the firm, under no circumstances
would they have been permitted to retire. The case of
these gentlemen is mentioned now simply to illustrate an idea and
not to found a complaint. On the incoming of the new administration,
General Thompson, in accordance with precedent,
promptly tendered his resignation, and it was as promptly accepted;
while General Superintendent Jameson struggled along
doing his work until, to relieve his chief from embarrassment, he,
too, tendered his resignation. The country was thus deprived of
the services of two men who were experts in their profession,
simply to give place to others, of high character, no doubt, but
with no knowledge and special aptitude for the great trust that
was committed to them. And now, in the first year of another
administration, the experience that many valuable officials have
gained has counted for nothing, and they have been rotated out.
In no other civilized country would such an atrocity be possible.
An attempt to remove, for similar reasons, such postal authorities
as Messrs. Rich, of Liverpool, Johnston, of Manchester, or Hubson,
of Glasgow, all of whom, under a sound, logical, just, and
economical business system, have reached their present positions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
by merit and efficiency from more or less inferior places, would
hurl an administration in Great Britain from power, and justly
too. The possession of the immense patronage of the Government
did not save the Republican party from defeat in 1884, or keep
the Democratic party in power in 1888. Ideas are stronger than
"soap," and principles more potent than spoils. It is due to
President Cleveland to state that toward the close of his administration
he recognized the importance of permanency in the Railway
Mail Service, and that he made a long step in advance by
approving a series of rules submitted by the Civil Service Commission
having for its object the removal of the service from the
influences of politicians. It needs more than this, however; it
needs the sanctity of the statute law, declaring that the clerks
should not only keep their offices during good behavior, but that
after twenty years of faithful and efficient service, or before that
time, if injured in the discharge of their duty, they should retire
on half-pay. In case of death from accident while on duty, proper
provision should be made for the family of the official. Whenever
justice is done by Congress in these particulars, the United States
will have the best and most efficient Railway Mail Service in the
world.</p>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_344dc.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap">The railroads of the world are to-day worth from
twenty-five to thirty thousand million dollars.
This probably represents one-tenth of the total
wealth of civilized nations, and one-quarter, if not
one-third, of their invested capital. It is doubtful
whether the aggregate plant used in all manufacturing
industries can equal it in value. The capital engaged in
banking is but a trifle beside it. The world's whole stock of
money of every kind&mdash;gold, silver, and paper&mdash;would purchase
only a third of its railroads.</p>

<p>Yet these facts by no means measure the whole importance of
the railroad in the modern industrial system. The business methods
of to-day are in one sense the direct result of improved means
of transportation. The railroad enables the large establishment
to reach the markets of the world with its products; it enables the
large city to receive its food-supplies, if necessary, from a distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
of hundreds or thousands of miles. And while it thus favors the
concentration of capital, it is in itself an extreme type of this
concentration. Almost every distinctive feature of modern business,
whether good or bad, finds in railroad history at once its
chief cause and its fullest development.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_345.jpg" width="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption">George Stephenson.</div>
</div>

<p>As befits a nineteenth century institution, the railroad dates
from 1801. In that year Benjamin Outram built in the suburbs of
London a short line of horse
railroad&mdash;or tramroad, as it was
named in honor of the inventor.
Other works of the same
kind followed in almost every
succeeding year. They were
recognized as a decided convenience,
but nothing more. It
was hard to imagine that a revolution
in the world's transportation
methods could grow out
of this beginning. Least of all
could such a result be foreseen
in England, whose admirable
canal system seemed likely to
defy competition for centuries
to come. And yet, curiously
enough, it was a man wholly
identified with canal business who first foresaw the future importance
of the railroad. The Duke of Bridgewater had built
canals when they were regarded as a hazardous speculation; but
they proved a success, and in the early years of the century he
was reaping a rich reward for his foresight. One of his fellow-shareholders
took occasion to congratulate the Duke on the fact
that their property was now the surest monopoly in the land, and
was startled by the reply, "I see mischief in these&mdash;tramroads."
The prophecy is all the more striking as coming from an enemy.
Like Balaam, the Duke of Bridgewater had a pecuniary interest
in cursing, but was so good a prophet that he had to tell the truth
in spite of himself, even though his curse was thereby turned into
a blessing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to tell in detail how this prediction was
realized. Thanks to the skill and perseverance of George Stephenson,
the difficulties in the use of steam as a mode of propulsion
were rapidly overcome. What was a doubtful experiment as late
as 1815 had become an accomplished fact in 1830. The successful
working of the Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway gave an impulse
to similar enterprises all over the world. In 1835 there were
1,600 miles of railroad in operation&mdash;more than half of it in the
United States. In 1845 the length of the world's railroads had increased
to more than 10,000 miles; in 1855 it was 41,000 miles;
in 1865, 90,000; in 1875, 185,000; in 1885, over 300,000.</p>

<p>There were perhaps a few men who foresaw this growth;
there were almost none who foresaw the changes in organization
and business methods with which it was attended. People at first
thought of the railroad as merely an improved highway, which
should charge tolls like a turnpike or canal, and on which the public
should run cars of its own, independent of the railroad company
itself. In many cases, especially in England, long sheets of tolls
were published, based on the model of canal charters, and naming
rates under which the use of the road-bed should be free to all.
This plan soon proved impracticable. If independent owners tried
to run trains over the same line, it involved a danger of collision
and a loss of economy. The former evil could perhaps be avoided;
the latter could not. The advantages of unity of management
were so great that a road running its own trains could do a
much larger business at lower rates than if ownership and carriage
were kept separate. The old plan was as impracticable as it
would be for a manufacturing company to own the buildings and
engines, while each workman owned the particular piece of machinery
which he handled. Almost all the technical advantages
of the new methods would be lost for lack of system. The railroad
company, to serve the public well, could not remain in the
position of a turnpike or canal company, but must itself do the
work of carriage.</p>

<p>This was not all. The same economy which resulted from the
union of road and rolling-stock under one management was still
further subserved by the consolidation of connecting lines. This
change did not come about so suddenly as the other. Half a century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
had elapsed before it was fully carried out. At first there
was no need of it. The early railroads were chiefly built for local
traffic, and especially for the carriage of local passengers. They
were like the horse railroads of the present day in the simplicity
of their organization and the shortness of their lines. England in
1847 had chartered 700 companies, with an average authorized
length of hardly fifteen miles each. The line from Albany to
Buffalo and Niagara Falls was in the hands of a dozen independent
concerns. These were but types of what existed all
over the world. As through traffic, and especially through freight
traffic, grew in importance, this state of things became intolerable.
Frequent transshipment was at once an expense to
the railroad and a burden to the public. Even when this could
be avoided, there was a multiplication of offices and a loss of
responsibility. The system of ownership and management had to
adapt itself to the technical necessities of the business. The
change was not the result of legislation; nor was it, except in a
limited sense, the work of men like Vanderbilt or Scott. It occurred
in all parts of the world at about the same time. It was
the result of business necessity, strong enough to shape legislation,
and to find administrative leaders who could meet its demands.</p>

<p>From the very first there were some men who felt the importance
of the railroads as national lines of communication. The
idea was present in the minds of the projectors of the Baltimore
&amp; Ohio, of the Erie, and of the Boston &amp; Albany. But it was
not until 1850 that it became a controlling one; nor was it universally
accepted even then. As late as 1858 we find that there
was a violent popular agitation in the State of New York to prohibit
the New York Central from carrying freight in competition
with the Erie Canal. It was gravely urged that the railroad had
no business to compete with the canal; that the latter had a natural
right to the through traffic from the West, with which the
railroads must not interfere. It is less than thirty years since a
convention at Syracuse, representing no small part of the public
sentiment of New York, formally recommended "the passage of
a law by the next Legislature which shall confine the railroads of
this State to the business for which they were originally created."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>But matters had gone too far for effective action of this kind.
Besides the New York Central, the Erie and the Pennsylvania
were in condition to handle the through traffic which Western connections
were furnishing. These connections themselves were
rapidly growing in importance. Prior to 1850 there were very few
railroads west of the Alleghanies. In 1857 there were thousands
of miles. The policy of land-grants acted as an artificial stimulus
to the building of such roads; and a land-grant road, when once
built, was almost necessarily dependent on through traffic for its
support. It could not be operated locally; it was forced into close
traffic arrangements which paved the way for actual consolidation.</p>

<p>The war brought this development to a stand-still for the time
being; but it was afterward resumed with renewed vigor. It is
probable that the final effect of the war was to hasten rather than
to retard the growth of large systems. In the first place, it familiarized
men's minds with national ideas instead of those limited
to their own State. It is hard for us to realize that our business
ideas were ever thus confined by artificial boundaries; but if we
wish proof, we have only to look at the original location of the Erie
Railway from Piermont to Dunkirk. Both were unnatural and undesirable
terminal points; but people were willing to submit to inconvenience
and to actual loss in order that the railroad might run
as far as the New York State limits would allow, and not one whit
farther. Similar instances can be found in other States. Hard as
it is to understand, there seems to have been a positive jealousy of
interstate traffic. The war did much to remove this by making
the different sections of the country feel their common interest and
their mutual dependence. It also had more direct effects. It produced
special legislation for the Pacific railroads as a measure of
military necessity; and this was but the beginning of a renewal of
the land-grant policy, no longer through the medium of the States,
but in the Territories and by the direct action of Congress. All
the results in the way of extension or consolidation which had been
noted in the first land-grant period were more intensely felt in the
second. Never was there a time when business foresight and
administrative power were more needed or more richly rewarded
than in railroad management during the third quarter of the
century.</p>

<div class="caption">J. Edgar Thomson.</div>
</div>

<p>In 1847 J. Edgar Thomson, an engineer of experience, entered
the service of the Pennsylvania Railroad, of which he afterward became
president. Three years later, a young man without experience
in railroad business applied to him for a position as clerk in
the station at Duncansville, and was, with some hesitation, accepted.
Not long after&mdash;so runs the story&mdash;an influential shipper entered
the station, and demanded that some transfers should be made in
a manner contrary to the rules of the company. This the clerk
refused to do; and when the influential shipper tried to attend to
the matter himself, he was forcibly ejected from the premises. Indignant
at this, he complained to the authorities, demanding that
the obnoxious employee be removed from his position. He was&mdash;and
was promoted to a much higher one. This is said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
been the beginning of the railroad career of Thomas Alexander
Scott. Edgar Thomson was a sufficiently able man to appreciate
Scott's talent at its full worth, and took every opportunity to make
it useful in the service of the company. Both before and after the
war the system was extended in every direction; and the man who
in 1850 had need of all his nerve to defy a single influential shipper
was a quarter of a century later at the head of 7,000 miles of the
most valuable railroad in the country.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_350.jpg" width="450" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Thomas A. Scott.</div>
</div>

<p>As an enterprising and active railroad organizer, Scott was
probably unrivalled&mdash;especially when aided by the soberer judgment
of Thomson; nor has the operating department of any other
railroad in the country reached the standard established on the
Pennsylvania by Scott and Thomson and the men trained up
under their eyes. But in business sagacity and those qualities
which pertain to the financial management of property, Scott was
surpassed by Vanderbilt. The work of the two men was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
totally different in character that it is hard to compare them.
Vanderbilt was not so distinctively a railroad man as Scott. He
had already made his mark as a ship-owner before he went into
railroads. But he was a man who was bound to take the lead in
the business world; and he saw that the day for doing it with
steamships was passing away, and that the day of railroads was
come. He therefore presented his best steamship to the United
States Government in a time when it was sorely needed, disposed
of the others in whatever way he could, and turned his undivided
attention to railroads.</p>

<p>In 1863 Vanderbilt began purchasing Harlem stock on a large
scale. The road was unprofitable, but he at once improved its
management and made it pay. Speculators on the other side of
the market had not foreseen the possibility of this course of action,
and were badly deceived in their calculations. Vanderbilt had begun
buying at as low a figure as 3; within little more than a year
he had forced some of its opponents to buy it of him at 285. He
soon extended his operations to Hudson River, and somewhat later
to New York Central. Defeated in an attempt to gain control of
Erie, he turned his attention farther west; and was soon in virtual
possession of a system which, in his hands at any rate, was fully a
match for all competitors.</p>

<p>These systems did not long remain without rivals. The Baltimore
&amp; Ohio, whose development had been interrupted by the
war, soon resumed, under the leadership of John W. Garrett, its
old commanding position in the railroad world. Farther west, in
the years succeeding, systems were developed and consolidated
which surpassed their eastern connections in aggregate mileage.
The combined Wabash and Missouri Pacific system in its best days
included about 10,000 miles of line under what was virtually a single
management. The Southern Pacific, the Atchison, the Northwestern,
and the St. Paul systems control each of them in one way or
another decidedly over 5,000 miles; and a half-dozen others might
be named, scarcely inferior either in magnitude or in commercial
power.</p>

<p>The result of all this was to place an enormous and almost
irresponsible power in the hands of a few men. The directors
of such a system stand for thousands of investors, tens of thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
of employees, and hundreds of thousands of shippers. They
have the interests of all these parties in their hands for good or ill.
If they are fit men for their places, they will work for the advantage
of all. A man like Vanderbilt gave higher profits, larger employment,
and lower rate as the result of his railroad work. But if the
head of such a system is unfit for his trust intellectually or morally,
the harm which he can do is almost boundless.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_352.jpg" width="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Cornelius Vanderbilt.</div>
</div>

<p>Of intellectual unfitness the chance is perhaps not great. The
intense competition of the modern business world makes sure that
any man, to maintain his position, must have at least some of the
qualities of mind which it exacts. But of moral unfitness the danger
is all the greater, because some of the present conditions of
business competition directly tend to foster it. A German economist
has said that the so-called survival of the fittest in modern industry
is really a double survival, side by side, of the most talented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
on the one hand and the most unscrupulous on the other. The
truth of this is already apparent in railroad business. A Vanderbilt
on the Central meets a Fisk on the Erie. In spite of his superior
power and resources he is virtually beaten in the contest&mdash;beaten,
as was said at the time, because he could not afford to go
so close to the door of State's prison as his rival.</p>

<p>The manager of a large railroad system has under his control a
great deal of property besides his own&mdash;the property of railroad
investors which has been placed in his charge. Two lines of action
are open to him. He may make money <em>for</em> the investors, and
thereby secure the respect of the community; or he may make
money <em>out</em> of the investors, and thereby get rich enough to defy
public opinion. The former course has the advantage of honesty,
the latter of rapidity. It is a disgrace to the community that the
latter way is made so easy, and so readily condoned. A man has
only to give to charitable objects a little of the money obtained by
violations of trust, and a large part of the world will extol him as a
public benefactor. Nay, more; it seems as if some of our financial
operators really mistook the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox populi</i> for the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox Dei</i>, and believed
that a hundred thousand dollars given to a theological seminary
meant absolution for the past and plenary indulgence for the
future. It is charged that one financier, when he undertook any
large transaction which was more than usually questionable, made
a covenant that if the Lord prospered him in his undertaking he
would divide the proceeds on favorable terms. But&mdash;as Wamba
said of the outlaws and "the fashion of their trade with Heaven"&mdash;"when
they have struck an even balance, Heaven help them
with whom they next open the account!"</p>

<p>A word or two as to the methods by which such operations are
carried on, and the system which makes them possible. From the
very first, railroads have been built and operated by corporations.
A number of investors, too large to attend personally to the management
of the enterprise, took shares of stock and elected officers
to represent them. These officers had almost absolute power;
but while matters were in this simple stage, there was no great
opportunity for its abuse. The losses of investors were due to
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</i> errors of judgment rather than to misuse of power. But
soon the corporations found it convenient to borrow money by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
mortgaging their property. We then had two classes of investors&mdash;stockholders
and bondholders, the former taking the risks and
having the full control of the property, the latter receiving a relatively
sure though perhaps smaller return, but having no control
over the management as long as their interest was regularly paid.</p>

<p>Of course there is always some danger when the men who
furnish the money do not have much control of the enterprise;
but as long as the relations of stock and bonds were in practice
what they pretended to be in theory, the resulting evils were not
very great. Matters soon reached another stage. The amount
of money furnished by the bondholders increased out of all proportion
to that furnished by the stockholders. Sometimes the
nominal amount of stock was unduly small; more commonly only
a very small part of the nominal value was ever paid in.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The
stock was nearly all water, simply issued by the directors as a
means of keeping control of the property. After the crisis of
1857, people had become shy of buying railroad stock; but they
bought railroad bonds because they thought they were safe. This
was the case only when there was an actual investment of stockholders
behind them; without this assurance, bonds were more
unsafe than stock had been, because the bondholders had still less
immediate control over the directors and officials. If there was
money to be made at the time, the directors made it; if there was
loss in the end, it fell upon the bondholders.</p>

<p>Let us take a specific case. An inside ring issues stock certificates
to the value of a million dollars, on which perhaps a hundred
thousand is paid in. They then publish their prospectus and
place on the market two million of bonds with which the road is
to be built. They sell the bonds at 80, reimburse themselves for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
the $100,000 advanced by charging the moderate commission of 5
per cent. for services in placing the loan, and have at their disposal
$1,500,000 cash. These same directors now appear as a
construction company, and award themselves a contract to pay
$1,500,000 for work which is worth $1,200,000 only. The road is
finished, and probably does not pay interest on its bonds. It
passes into the hands of a receiver. Possibly the old management
may have an influence in his appointment. At the worst, they
have got back all the money they put in, <em>plus</em> the profits of the
construction company; in the case supposed, 300 per cent. The
bondholders, on the other hand, have paid $1,600,000 for a $1,200,000
road.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_355.jpg" width="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">John W. Garrett.</div>
</div>

<p>But the troubles of the bondholders and the advantages of the
old directors by no means end here. When the receiver takes
possession he discovers that valuable terminals, necessary for the
successful working of the road, are not the property of the company,
but of the old directors. He finds that the road owns a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
very inadequate supply of rolling-stock, and that the deficiency
has been made up by a car-trust&mdash;also under the control of the
old directors. Each of these things, and perhaps others, must be
made the subject of a fight or of a compromise. The latter is
often the only practicable alternative, and almost always the
cheaper one; by its terms the ring perhaps secures hundreds of
thousands more, at the expense of the actual investors.</p>

<p>These are but a few of the many ways in which a few years'
control of property may be made profitable to the officials at the
expense of legitimate interests. In a case like this, all depends
upon the possibility of selling bonds. It is usually impossible to
place the whole loan before construction; and if the market-price
falls below the cost of the work undertaken, as was the case with
the West Shore, the loss falls upon the construction company.
Such accidents were for a long time rare. It took the public
nearly twenty years to learn the true character of imperfectly secured
railroad bonds. Within the past five years it seems to have
become a trifle wiser. The crisis of 1873 was insufficient to teach
the lesson; but that of 1885 has been at least partially successful
in this respect.</p>

<p>In cases like the one just described the bondholders are largely
to blame for their own folly. But sometimes the loss falls on
those who are in no way responsible for it. A railroad may be
built as a blackmailing job. If a company is sound and prosperous,
speculators may be tempted to build a parallel road, not with
the idea of making it pay, but because they can so damage the
business of the old road as to force it to buy them out. They
build the road to sell.</p>

<p>It is but fair to say that operations as bad as those just described
are the exception rather than the rule. But the fact that they can
exist at all is by no means creditable to our financial methods.
The whole system by which directors can use their positions of
trust to make contracts in which they are personally interested
puts a premium on dishonesty. Such contracts are forbidden in
England. It may be true, as is urged by many railroad officials
of undoubted honesty, that it would be inconvenient to apply the
same law here; but on the whole, the gain would far outweigh
the loss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>At the very best, a railroad president is subject to temptations
to misuse his financial powers, all the more dangerous because it
is impossible to draw the line between right and wrong. He
knows the probable value of his railroad and of the property affected
by its action a great deal better than any outsider possibly
can. The published figures of earnings of the road are the result
of estimates by himself and his subordinates. Out of the current
earnings he pays current expenses, and probably charges permanent
expenditures to capital account. But what expenditures are
current and what are permanent? This division is itself the result
of an estimate, and a very doubtful one at that. There are
some well-established general principles, but none which will apply
themselves automatically. With the best will in the world he
cannot make his annual reports give a thoroughly clear idea of
what has been done. Is he to be forbidden to buy stock when it
seems too low, or sell it when it is high? Shall we refuse him the
right to invest in other property which he sees will advance in
value? Apparently not; and yet, if we allow this, we open the
door for some of the worst abuses of power which have occurred
in railroad history. The line between good faith and bad faith in
these matters is a narrow one, and the average conscience cannot
be trusted to locate it with accuracy.</p>

<p>But the relations to the investors cover but a small part either
of the work or of the responsibility of the railroad authorities.
They are managing not merely a piece of property, but a vast and
complicated organization of men, and an instrument of public service.
In all these capacities their cares are equally great. The
operating and the traffic departments are not less important than
the financial department. The relations of the railroad to its employees,
and to the business community at large, are even more
perplexing than its relations to the investors.</p>

<p>Of the questions arising between the railroad and its employees
we are just beginning to realize the full importance. They are
not matters to be settled by private agreement or private war. If
they involve a serious interruption of the business of the community
they concern public interests most vitally. The community
cannot afford to have its business interrupted by railroad strikes.
On the other hand, it cannot allow the men to make this public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
duty of the railroads a means of enforcing their own will on every
occasion, to the detriment of all discipline and responsibility, or in
disregard of investors' rights. How to compromise between these
two conflicting requirements is one of the most serious problems
of the immediate future.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Little progress in this direction has as
yet been made, or even systematically attempted.</p>

<p>The questions arising from the relations of the railroads to
those who use them are wider and older. From the very outset
attempts were made to regulate railroad charges by law in various
ways. The fear at that time was that they might be made unreasonably
high. This fear proved groundless. From the outset
the rates were rather lower than had been expected, and much
lower than by many of the means of transportation which railroads
superseded. These low rates caused a great development in
business; and this, in turn, gave a chance for such economy in
handling it that rates went still lower. Each new invention rendered
it easier to do a large business at cheap rates. The substitution
of steel rails for iron, which began shortly after the close of
the war, had an enormous influence in this respect. This was not
merely due to the direct saving in repairs, which, though appreciable,
was moderate in amount. It was due still more to improvements
in transportation which followed. It was found that steel
rails would bear heavier rolling-stock. Instead of building ten-ton
cars to carry ten tons of cargo, companies built twelve-ton cars
to carry twenty tons of cargo, or fourteen-ton cars to carry thirty
tons; and they made the locomotives heavy enough to handle
correspondingly larger trains. A given amount of fuel was made
to haul more weight; and of the weight thus hauled, the freight
formed a constantly increasing proportion as compared with the
rolling-stock itself. The system of rates was adopted to meet the
new requirements. Charges were made incredibly low in order
to fill cars that would otherwise go empty, or to use the road as
nearly as possible to its full capacity. In the twenty years following
the introduction of steel rails the traffic of the New York
Central increased from less than 400,000,000 ton-miles to decidedly
over 2,000,000,000; while the average rates fell from 3.09 cents
per ton per mile in 1866 to 0.76 cent in 1886. This is but a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
instance of a process which has gone on all over the country.
The average freight charge on all railroads of the country to-day
is a little over one cent per ton a mile: less than half what would
have been deemed possible on any railroad a few years ago.</p>

<p>The progress of railroad consolidation contributed greatly
to this economy. It saved multiplication of offices; it saved re-handling
of freight; it enabled long-distance business to be done
systematically. So great were its advantages that co-operation
between connecting lines was carried far beyond the limits of actual
consolidation. Through traffic was handled without transshipment,
sometimes by regularly incorporated express companies or
freight companies on the same plan, but more commonly by what
are known as fast-freight lines.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> These are little more than combinations
for keeping account of through business; they are by no
means ideal in their working, but they have the advantage of few
expenses and no income, so that the temptation to steal, which
is the bane of such organizations, is here reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>But all these things, while they increased the efficiency of the
service, also increased the power of the railroad authorities and
rendered the shipper more helpless. The very cheapness of rates
only made a recourse to other means of transportation more difficult.
If <em>A</em> was charged 30 cents while his competitor <em>B</em> was paying
only 20 cents for the same service, he was worse off than
when they were both paying a dollar; and the fact that no other
means of conveyance could be found to do the work for less than
a dollar simply put <em>A</em> all the more completely at the mercy of
the railroad freight-agent. In other words, the fact that rates
were so low made any inequality in rates all the more dangerous.
The lower the rate and the wider the monopoly, the less was the
chance of relief.</p>

<p>Such inequalities existed on a large scale: and they were all
the more difficult to deal with because there was a certain reason
for some of them arising from the nature of railroad business.
The expenses of a railroad are of two kinds. Some, like train and
station service, locomotive fuel, or repairs of rolling-stock, are
pretty directly chargeable to the different parts of the traffic. It
costs a certain amount in wages and in materials to run a particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
train; if that train is taken off, that part of the expense is
saved. But there is another class of items, known as fixed
charges, that do not vary with the amount of business done. Interest
on bonds must be paid, whether the volume of traffic be
large or small. The services of track-watchmen must be paid for,
whether there be a hundred trains daily or only a dozen. In
short, most of the expenses for interest and maintenance of way
are chargeable to the business as a whole, but not to particular
pieces of work done. The practical inference from this is obvious.
In order that the railroad as a whole may be profitable, the fixed
charges must be paid somehow. The railroad manager will try
to get them as he can from different parts of his traffic. But if,
for any reason, a particular piece of business cannot or will not
pay its share of the fixed charges, it is better to secure it at any
price above the bare expense of loading and hauling, without
regard to the fixed charges. For if the business is lost, these
charges will run on just the same, without any added means of
meeting them.</p>

<p>The consequence is that there is no natural standard of rates;
or, rather, that there are two standards, so far apart that the difference
between the two is quite sufficient to build up one establishment
or one locality and ruin another, in case of an arbitrary exercise
of power on the part of the freight-agent. In the use of such
a power it was inevitable that there should be a great many mistakes,
and some things which were worse than mistakes. Colbert
once cynically defined taxation as "the art of so plucking the
goose as to secure the largest amount of feathers with the least
amount of squealing." Some of our freight-agents have taken
Colbert's tax theories as a standard, and have applied them only
too literally. It is this short-sighted policy which has made the
system of charging "what the traffic will bear" a synonyme for extortion.
Interpreted rightly, this phrase represents a sound principle
of railroad policy&mdash;putting the burden of the fixed charges on
the shipments that can afford to pay them. But practically&mdash;in
the popular mind at least&mdash;it has come to mean almost exactly the
opposite.</p>

<p>The points which got the benefit of the lowest rates were the
large trade centres, which had the benefit of competing lines of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
railroad, and often of water competition also. The threat to ship
goods by a rival route was the surest way of making a freight-agent
give low rates. The result was that the growth of such
places was specially stimulated. In addition to their natural advantages
they had an artificial one due to the policy of competing
lines of railroad. It may well be the case, as is argued by railroad
men, that sound railroad economy demands that goods in
large masses should be carried much more cheaply than those
which are furnished in smaller quantities. But it is certain the
practice went far beyond the limits of any such justification. There
was a time when cattle were carried from Chicago to New York
at a dollar a car-load; and many other instances, scarcely less
marked, could be cited from the history of trunk-line competition.
The fact was, that in an active railroad war freight-agents
would generally accede to a demand for reduced rates at a competing
point, whether well founded or not, and would almost always
turn a deaf ear to similar demands from local shippers, however
strongly supported by considerations of far-sighted business
policy.</p>

<p>But this was not the worst. Inequalities between different
places might after some hardship correct themselves; differences
of treatment between individuals could not be thus adjusted. And
the system of making rates by special bargain almost always led
to differences between individuals, where favors were too often
given to those who needed or deserved them least. The fluctuation
of rates was first taken advantage of by the unscrupulous
speculator. Often, if he controlled large sources of shipment, he
might receive the benefit of a secret agreement by which he could
obtain lower rates than his rivals under all circumstances. A more
effective means for destroying straightforwardness in business
dealings than the old system of special rates was never devised.
Sometimes, where one competitor was overwhelmingly strong, the
pretence of secrecy was thrown aside, and the railroad companies
so far forgot their public duties as almost openly to assist one concern
in crushing its rivals. The state of things in this respect
twelve or fifteen years ago was so bad that it is painful to dwell
upon; but the reformation to-day is not so complete that we can
wash our hands of past sins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>Less was said or felt of similar evils in passenger traffic, because
the passenger business of the country generally is of much
less importance than its freight business, either to the railroad investors
or to the producers themselves. But there was the same
fluctuation in passenger rates; and there was an outrageous form
of discrimination in the development of the free-pass system; a
practice which would have fully deserved the name of systematic
bribery, had it not become so universal that most men hardly recognized
any personal obligation connected with the acceptance of
a pass. Officials and other citizens of influence had come to regard
it as a right; it was not so much bribery on the part of the
companies as blackmail levied against them.</p>

<p>The remedies proposed for all these evils have been various.
From the very beginning until now there have been some who
held that such abuses could be avoided only by State railroad ownership.
Such experiments in the United States have not gone far
enough to furnish conclusive evidence either way; but the experience
of other countries indicates that State railroads, as such, do not
avoid these evils. Where they have been worked in competition
with other lines, they have been as deeply involved in these abuses
as their private competitors&mdash;perhaps more so. Where the government
has obtained control of all the railroads of the country,
and made such arrangements with the water-routes as to render
competition impossible, the abuses have vanished, because there
was no longer any conceivable motive to continue them. But this
was the result of the monopoly, not of the State ownership; and
the advantage was purchased by a sacrifice of all the stimulus of
competition toward the development of new facilities.</p>

<p>Many people assume that, because the government represents
the nation as a whole, therefore government officials will not be
under the same temptations to act unjustly which are felt by the
representatives of a private corporation. This is a mistake. It is
not as representatives of the investor that railroad agents do much
injustice; this motive has practically nothing to do with it. Most
of the abuses complained of are positively injurious to the investor
in the long run. When officials really represent the interests of
the property with wise foresight, they, as a rule, give the public no
ground to complain. The question reduces itself to this: Will the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
State choose better representatives and agents than a private corporation?
Will it secure a higher grade of officials, more competent,
more honest, and more enterprising? The difference between
state and private railroads is not so much on matters of
policy as on methods of administration. The success of government
administration varies with different countries. In Prussia,
where it is seen at its best, the results are in some respects remarkably
good; yet even here the roads are not managed on anything
like the American standard of efficiency, either in amount of
train service, in speed, or in rapidity of development. And what
is barely successful in Prussia, with its trained civil service on the
one hand and its less intense industrial demands on the other, can
hardly be considered possible or desirable in America. No one
who has watched the workings of a government contract can desire
to have the whole trade of the country put to the expense of
supporting such methods in its transportation business.</p>

<p>A more easy method of trying to regulate railroad charges has
been by forced reductions in rates. This was tried on the largest
scale in the Granger movement fifteen years ago. A fall in the
price of wheat had rendered it difficult for the farmers to make
money. The Patrons of Husbandry, in investigating the causes,
saw that the larger trade centres, where there was competition,
were getting lower rates than the local producer. They reasoned
that if all the farmers could get such low rates, they could make
money; and that, if the roads could afford to make these low
rates for any points, they could afford to do it for all. The railroad
agents, instead of foreseeing the storm and trying to prevent
it, assumed a defiant attitude. The result was that legislatures
of the States in the upper Mississippi Valley passed laws of more
or less rigidity, scaling down all rates to the general level of competitive
ones. After a period of some doubt, the right of the States
to do this was admitted by the courts. But before the legal
possibility had been decided, the practical impossibility of such a
course had been shown. If all rates were reduced to the level of
competitive ones, it left nothing to pay fixed charges. On such
terms, foreign capital would not come into the State; nor could it
be enticed by such a clumsy effort as that of one of the States,
which provided "that no road <em>hereafter constructed</em> shall be subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
to the provisions of this act." The goose which laid the
golden eggs was not such a goose as to be deceived by this. The
untimely death of several of her species meant more than any
promises of immunity to those who should follow in her footsteps.
In those States which had passed the most severe laws capital
would not invest; railroads could not pay interest, their development
stopped, and the growth of the community was seriously
checked thereby. The most obnoxious laws were either repealed
or allowed to remain in abeyance. Where the movement was
strongest in 1873 it had practically spent its force in 1876. There
have been many similar attempts in all parts of the country since
that time; just now they are peculiarly active; but nothing which
approaches in recklessness some of the legislation of 1873 and 1874.
The lesson was at least partly learned.</p>

<p>We had hardly passed the crisis of the effort to level down,
when some of the more intelligent railroad men made an effort to
level up. Recognizing that discriminations and fluctuating rates
were an evil, they sought to avoid it by common action with regard
to the business at competing points. A mere agreement as to
rates to be charged was not enough to secure this end. Such an
agreement was sure to be violated. Even if the leading authorities
meant to observe it, their agents could always evade its requirements
to some extent. Such evasion was favored by loose arrangements
between connecting roads, and by the somewhat irresponsible
system of fast freight lines. Wherever it existed, it
gave rise to mutual suspicion. <em>A</em> believed that his road did it because
he could not help it, but that <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> were allowing their
roads to do it maliciously; while <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> had the same consciousness
of individual rectitude and the same unkind suspicions with
regard to <em>A</em>. It was at best a rather hollow truce, which did not
really accomplish its purpose, and which might change to open
war on very slight provocation.</p>

<p>To avoid this difficulty a pool, or division of traffic, was arranged.
It is a fact that, whatever wars of rates there may be,
the percentage of traffic carried by the different lines varies but
little. If an arbitrator can examine the books and decide what
these percentages have been in the past, he can make an award for
the future, under which the competitive traffic of the different roads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
may be fairly divided. The arrangements for doing this are various.
Sometimes the roads carry such traffic as may happen to be
offered, and settle the differences with one another by money balances;
sometimes they actually divert traffic from one line to
another. But the advantage of either of these arrangements over
a mere agreement to maintain rates is that they cannot be violated
without direct action on the part of the leading authorities of the
roads concerned&mdash;either in open withdrawal, or in actual bad faith.
The ordinary irregularities of agents do not, under a pooling
system, give rise to much suspicion, because they do not benefit
the road in whose behalf they are undertaken. Its percentage
being fixed there is no motive for rate-cutting. So great is this
advantage that pooling is accepted in almost all other countries as
a natural means of maintaining equality of rates; the state railroads
of Central Europe entering into such contracts with competing
private lines and even with water-routes. In America itself,
pools have had a longer and wider history than is generally supposed.
In New England they arose and continued to exist on a
moderate scale without attracting much attention. In the Mississippi
Valley, the Chicago-Omaha pool was arranged as early as
1870, and formed the model for a whole system of such arrangements
extending as far as the Pacific Coast. But, as involving
wider questions of public policy, the activity of the Southern and
the Trunk Line Associations has attracted chief attention.</p>

<p>The man whose name is most prominently identified with both
these systems is Albert Fink. A German by birth and education,
his long experience as a practical railroad engineer did not deprive
him of a taste for studying traffic problems on their theoretical
side. As Vice-President of the Louisville &amp; Nashville, he had
given special attention to the economic conditions affecting the
Southern roads; and when, in the years 1873&ndash;75, a traffic association
was formed by a number of these roads to secure harmony of
action on matters of common interest, he became the recognized
leader. His success in arrangements for through traffic was so
conspicuous that when, in 1877, the trunk lines were exhausted
with an unusually destructive war of rates, they looked to him as
the only man who could deliver them from their trouble. In some
lines, division of traffic had already been resorted to; but it was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
the hands of outside parties, like the Standard Oil Company or the
cattle eveners, and was made a means of oppression against shippers
not in the combination itself.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">Albert Fink.</div>
</div>

<p>The conditions were not favorable; the result of Fink's efforts
to bring order out of chaos was slow and by no means uninterrupted.
Yet on the whole, as was admitted even by opponents of
the pooling system, it contributed to steadiness and equality of
rates. The arrangement of these agreements was hampered by
their want of legal status. While the law did not at that time actually
prohibit them, it refused to enforce them. Existing thus on
sufferance, they depended on the good will of the contracting parties.
None but a man of Fink's unimpeached integrity and high
intellectual power could have kept matters running at all; and even
he could not prevent the adoption of a policy of making hay while
the sun shines, more or less regardless of the future. The results
of the trunk-line pool were unsatisfactory&mdash;most of all to those who
believed in pools as a system; but it is fair to attribute a large part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
of this failure to the absence of legal recognition, which in a manner
compelled the agreements to be arranged to meet the demands
of the day rather than of the future.</p>

<p>Meantime an equally important contribution to the solution of
the railroad question was being worked out in another quarter. In
the year 1869 the Massachusetts Railroad Commission was established.
Its powers were so slight that it was not regarded as likely
to be an influential public agency. Fortunately it numbered among
its members Charles Francis Adams, Jr.; a man whose efficiency
more than made up for any want of nominal powers. In his hands
the mere power to report became the most effective of all weapons.
Representing at once enlightened public judgment and far-sighted
railroad policy, he did much to bring the two into harmony and
protect the legitimate interests on both sides from short-sighted
misuse for the benefit of either party. The detail of his work is
matter of past history; perhaps its most prominent result was to
introduce to State legislation the idea of a railroad commission as
an administrative body. Those States which had no stringent
laws appointed commissions to
take their place; those which
had overstringent ones appointed
commissions to use discretion
in applying them. In
either case, the existence of a
body of men representing the
State, but possessing the technical
knowledge to see what
the exigencies of railroad business
demanded, was a protection
to all parties concerned.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_367.jpg" width="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Charles Francis Adams.</div>
</div>

<p>But matters were rapidly
passing beyond the sphere of
State legislation. Each new
consolidation of systems, each
additional development of through traffic, made it more impossible
to control railroad policy by the action of individual States. It
could only be done by a development of the law in the United
States courts or by Congressional legislation. The former result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
was necessarily slow; each year showed an increased demand for
special action on the part of Congress. But such action was hindered
by divergence of opinion in that body itself. One set of
men wished a moderate law, prohibiting the most serious abuses
of railroad power, and enforced under the discretionary care of a
commission. These men were for the most part not unwilling to
see pools legalized if their members could thereby be held to a
fuller measure of responsibility. On the other hand, the extremists
wished to prescribe a system of equal mileage rates; they would
hear of no such thing as a commission, and hated pools as an invention
of the adversary. Between the two lay a large body of
members who had no convictions on the matter, but were desirous
to please everybody and offend nobody&mdash;a hard task in this particular
case. It was nearly nine years from the time Mr. Reagan
introduced his first bill when a compromise was finally effected&mdash;largely
by the influence of Senator Cullom. As compromises go,
it was a tolerably fair one. The extremists sacrificed their opposition
to a commission, but secured the prohibition of pools; the
disputed points with regard to rates were left in such a shape that
no man knew what the law meant, and each was, for the time being,
able to interpret it to suit the wishes of his Congressional district.</p>

<p>The immediate effects of the law were extremely good. There
were certain sections of it, like those which secured publicity of
rates and equal treatment for different persons in the same circumstances,
whose wisdom was universally admitted. Indeed it was
rather a disgrace, both to the railroad agents and to the courts,
that we had to wait for an act of Congress to secure these ends;
and most of the railroads made up for past remissness in this respect
by quite a spasm of virtue. In some instances it was even
thought that they "stood up so straight as to lean over backward."
But this was not the only part of the law which proved
efficient. The very vagueness of the clause concerning the relative
rates for through and local traffic, which under other circumstances
might have proved fatal, put a most salutary power into
the hands of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and one which
they were not slow to use.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_369.jpg" width="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Thomas M. Cooley.</div>
</div>

<p>The President was fortunate in his selection of commissioners;
above all in the chairman, Judge T. M. Cooley, of Michigan, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
man whose character, knowledge of public law, and technical familiarity
with railroad business made him singularly well fitted for the
place. The work of the Interstate Commission, like that of its
Massachusetts prototype, shows
how much more important is
personal power than mere technical
authority. It was supposed
at first that the commission would
be a purely administrative body,
with discretion to suspend the
law. Instead of this, they have
enforced and interpreted it; and
in the process of interpretation
have virtually created a body of
additional law, which is read and
quoted as authority. With but
little ground for expecting it from
the letter of the act, they have become a judicial body of the highest
importance. Their existence seems to furnish a possibility for
an elastic development of transportation law, neither so weak as
to be ineffective nor so strong as to break by its own rigidity.</p>

<p>But the final test of their success is yet to come. They have
laid down a few principles as to the cases when competition justifies
through rates lower than those at intermediate points. But
the application of these principles is as yet far from settled; and it
is rendered doubly hard by the clause against pools, which does
much to hamper the roads in any attempt to secure common action
on the matter of through rates. Each ill-judged piece of State
legislation, and each reckless attempt to attack railroad profits, increases
the difficulty. There was a time when the powers of railroad
managers were developed without corresponding responsibility.
In many parts of the country we are now going to the
other extreme&mdash;increasing the responsibility of railroad authorities
toward shipper and employees, State law and national commission,
and at the same time striving to restrict their powers to the utmost.
Such a policy cannot be continued indefinitely without a disastrous
effect upon railroad service, and, indirectly, upon the business of
the country as a whole.</p>

about four thousand million dollars each. Most of the debt represents money actually paid in; but a
very large fraction of the stock is a merely nominal liability on which no payments have been made.
Some was issued as here described merely as a means of keeping control of the property; some, as
the easiest method of balancing unequal values in reorganization; some, to represent increased value
of the property, so as to be able to divide all the current earnings without calling public attention too
prominently to the very profitable character of the business. On the other hand, some stock on which
money was actually paid has been wiped out of existence; and something has been paid out of earnings
for capital account without corresponding issue of securities. The net amount of "water," or
excess of nominal liabilities over actual investments, in the capital account of the railroads of the country
can only be made the subject of guesswork. Estimates of responsible authorities vary all the way
from nothing to $4,000,000,000.</p></div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_370dc.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">In 1836&mdash;fifty years ago&mdash;there were but a little more than
1,000 miles of railroad on the American continents, representing
an outlay of some $35,000,000, and controlled by
a score or so of corporations. There are now (1886) about 135,000
miles in the United States alone, capitalized at over eight
thousand millions of dollars.</p>

<p>The railroad interest is thus the largest single interest in the
country. Probably 600,000 men are in its employ as wage-earners.
It is safe to say that over two millions of human beings are
directly dependent upon it for their daily support. The Union
Pacific, as a single and by no means the largest member of this
system, controls 5,150 miles of road, represented by stock and
bonds to the amount of $275,000,000. More than 15,000 names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
are borne upon its pay-rolls. Its yearly income has exceeded
$29,000,000, and in 1885 was $26,000,000. Large as these aggregates
sound, there are other corporations which far exceed the
Union Pacific both in income and in capitalization, and not a few
exceed it in mileage. The Pennsylvania, for instance, either owns
or directly controls 7,300 miles of road. It is represented by a
capitalization of $670,000,000; its annual income is $93,000,000;
it carries 75,000 names on its pay-rolls.</p>

<p>This has been the outgrowth of a single half-century. The
vast and intricate organization implied in the management of such
an interest had, as it were, to be improvised. The original companies
were small and simple affairs. Some retired man of business
held, as a rule, the position of president; while another
man, generally a civil engineer, and as such supposed to be
more or less acquainted with the practical working of railroads,
acted as superintendent. The superintendent, in point of fact, attended
to everything. He was the head of the commercial department;
the head of the operating department; the head of
the construction department; and the head of the mechanical department.
But there is a limit to what any single man can do;
and so, as the organization developed, it became necessary to relieve
the railroad superintendent of many of his duties. Accordingly,
the working management naturally subdivided itself into
separate departments, at the head of which men were placed who
had been trained all their lives to do the particular work required
in each department. In the same way, the employees of the company&mdash;the
wage-earners, as they are called&mdash;originally few in
number, held toward the company relations similar to those which
the employees in factories, shops, or on farms, held to those who
employed them. In other words, there was in the railroad system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
no organized service. As the employees increased until they
were numbered by hundreds, better organization became a necessity.
The community was absolutely dependent upon its railroad
service for continued existence, for the running of trains is to the
modern body politic very much what the circulation of blood is to
the human being. An organized system, therefore, had to grow
up. This fact was not recognized at first; and, indeed, is only
imperfectly recognized yet. Still the fact was there; and inasmuch
as it was there and was not recognized, trouble ensued. No
rationally organized railroad service&mdash;that is, no service in which
the employer and employed occupy definite relations toward each
other, recognized by each, and by the body politic&mdash;no such service
exists. Approaches to it only have been made. A discussion,
therefore, of the form that such a service would naturally
take if it were organized, cannot be otherwise than timely.</p>

<p>It has already been noticed that in the process of organization
the railroad, following the invariable law, naturally subdivides itself
into different departments.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> In the case of every corporation
of magnitude there are of these departments, whether one man is
at the head of one or several of them, at least five. These are:</p>

<p>1st. The financial department, which provides the ways and
means.</p>

<p>2d. The construction department, which builds the railroad
after the means to build it are provided.</p>

<p>3d. The operating department, which operates the road after
it is built.</p>

<p>4th. The commercial department, which finds business for the
operated road to do, and regulates the rates which are to be
charged for doing it.</p>

<p>5th. The legal department, which attends to all the numerous
questions which arise in the practical working of everyone of the
other departments.</p>

<p>These five divisions of necessary work exist in the organization
of every company, no matter how small it may be, or how few
officers it may employ. In the larger companies the need is found
for yet other special departments. In the case of the Union
Pacific, for instance, there are two such: First, the comptroller's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
department, which establishes and is responsible for the whole
method of accounting; second, a department which is responsible
for all the numerous interests which a large railroad company
almost of necessity develops outside of its strict, legitimate work
as a common carrier.</p>

<p>When it comes to dealing with the employees of the company,
it will be found that the vast majority of those whose names are
on the pay-rolls belong to the operating department. This department
is responsible not only for the running of trains and,
usually, for the maintenance of the permanent way, but also for
the repairs of rolling stock. All the train-hands, all the section-men
and bridge-gangs, and all the mechanics in the repair shops
thus belong to the operating department. The accounting department
employs only clerks. The same is true of the commercial
department, though the commercial department has also agents at
different business centres who look after the company's interests
and secure traffic for it. The construction department is in the
hands of civil engineers, and the force employed by it depends entirely
upon the amount of building which may at any time be going
on. As a rule, the bulk of the employees in the construction department
are paid by contractors, and not directly by the railroad
company. The legal department consists only of lawyers and
the few clerks necessary to aid them in transacting their business.</p>

<p>In the operating department of the Union Pacific at the present
time (1886) about 14,000 names are carried upon the pay-roll.
The number varies according to the season of the year and the
pressure of traffic. In January, and during the winter months, the
average will fall to 12,000, while in June and during the summer it
rises to 14,000.</p>

<p>Of these, 2,800, or 20 per cent., are engaged in train movement;
4,200, or 30 per cent, are in the machine-shops and in
charge of motive power and rolling-stock; 7,000, or 50 per cent.,
are employed in various miscellaneous ways, as flag-men, section-hands,
station agents, switch-men, etc., etc.</p>

<p>So far as the wage-earner is concerned, it is, therefore, this
portion of the force of a railroad company which may be called
distinctively "the service." If good relations exist between the
men employed in its operating department and the company no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
serious trouble can ever arise in the operation of the road. The
clerks in the financial department, or the engineers in the construction
department, might leave the company's employ in a body,
and their places could soon be filled. In point of fact, they never
do leave it; but should they do so, the public would experience no
inconvenience. The inconvenience&mdash;and it would be very considerable&mdash;would
be confined to the office of the company, and
their work would fall into arrears. It is not so with the operating
department. So far as the community at large is concerned, whatever
difficulties arise in the working of railroads develop themselves
here. All serious railroad strikes take place among those
engaged in the shops, on the track, or in handling trains. That
these difficulties should be reduced to a minimum is therefore a
necessity. They can be reduced to a minimum only when the railroad
service is thoroughly organized.</p>

<p>How then can this service be better organized than it is? It
is usually maintained that only the ordinary relation of employer
and employed should exist between the railroad company and the
men engaged in operating its road. If the farmer is dissatisfied with
his hands, he can dismiss them. In like manner, if the laborer is
dissatisfied with the farmer, he can leave his employ. It is argued
that exactly the same relation should exist between the great
railroad corporation and the tens of thousands of men in its operating
department. The proposition is not tenable. The circumstances
are different. In the first place, it is of no practical consequence
to the community whether difficulties which prevent the
work of the farm from going on arise or do not arise between
an individual farmer and his laborers. The work of innumerable
other farms goes on all the same, and it is a matter of indifference
what occurs in the management of the particular farm. So it is
even with large factories, machine-shops&mdash;in fact, with all industrial
concerns which do not perform immediate public functions. A
railroad company does perform immediate public functions. The
community depends upon it for the daily and necessary movements
of civilized existence. This fact has to be recognized. For a railroad
to pause in its operation implies paralysis to the community
which it serves.</p>

<p>Such being the fact, it is futile to argue that the ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
relations of employer and employed should obtain in the railroad
service. Something else is required; and because something else
is required but has not yet been devised we have had the numerous
difficulties which have taken place during the present year&mdash;difficulties
which have occasioned the community much inconvenience
and loss.</p>

<p>The model railroad service, therefore, is now to be considered.
Of what would it consist? At present, there is practically no
difference between individuals in the employ of a great railroad
corporation. All the wage-earners in its pay stand in like position
toward it. There should be a difference among them; and a
marked difference, due to circumstances which should receive recognition.
Take again the case of the Union Pacific. The Union
Pacific, it has already been mentioned, numbers 14,000 employees
in its operating department as a maximum, and 12,000 as a
minimum. They vary with the season of the year, increasing in
summer and diminishing in winter. Consequently there is a large
body of men who are permanently in its employ; and there is a
smaller body, although a very considerable portion of the whole,
who are in its employ only temporarily. Here is a fact, and facts
should be recognized. If this particular fact is recognized, the
service of the company should be organized accordingly, and each
of the several divisions of the operating department would have on
its rolls two classes of men: First, those who have been admitted
into the permanent service of the company; and, second, those
who for any cause are only temporarily in that service. And no
man should be admitted into the permanent service until after he
has served an apprenticeship in the temporary service. In other
words, admission into the permanent service would be in the nature
of a promotion from an apprenticeship in the temporary service.</p>

<p>Those in the temporary service need not, therefore, be at present
considered. They hold to the companies only the ordinary
relation of employee to employer. They may be looked upon as
candidates for admission into the permanent service&mdash;they are on
probation. So long as they are on probation they may be engaged
and discharged at pleasure. The permanent service alone
is now referred to.</p>

<p>The permanent service of a great railroad company should in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
many essential respects be very much like a national service, that of
the army or navy, for instance, except in one particular, and a very
important particular: to wit, those in it must of necessity always
be at liberty to resign from it&mdash;in other words, to leave it. The
railroad company can hold no one in its employ one moment against
his will. Meanwhile, to belong to the permanent service of a
railroad company of the first class, so far as the employee is concerned,
should mean a great deal. It should carry with it certain
rights and privileges which would cause that service to be eagerly
sought. In the first place, he who had passed through his period
of probation and whose name was enrolled in the permanent service
would naturally feel that his interests were to a large extent
identified with those of the company; and that he on the other
hand had rights and privileges which the company was bound to
respect. It has been a matter of boast in France that every private
soldier in the French army carried the possibility of the field-marshal's
baton in his knapsack. It should be the same with every
employee in the permanent service of a great American railroad
company. The possibility of his rising to any position in that
service for which he showed himself qualified should be open before
him and constantly present in his mind. Many of the most
remarkable and successful men who have handled railroads in the
United States began their active lives as brakemen, as telegraph
operators, even as laborers on the track. Such examples are of
inestimable value. They reveal possibilities open to all.</p>

<p>Beyond this, the man who is permanently enrolled should feel
that, though he may not rise to a high position, yet, as a matter of
right, he is entitled to hold the position to which he has risen just
so long as he demeans himself properly and does his duty well.
He should be free from fear of arbitrary dismissal. In order that
he may have this security, a tribunal should be devised before
which he would have the right to be heard in case charges of misdemeanor
are advanced against him.</p>

<p>No such tribunal has yet been provided in the organization of
any railroad company; neither, as a rule, has the suggestion of
such a tribunal been looked upon with favor either by the official or
the employee. The latter is apt to argue that he already has such
a tribunal in the executive committee of his own labor organization;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
and a tribunal, too, upon which he can depend to decide always
in his favor. The official, on the other hand, contends that
if he is to be responsible for results he must have the power of
arbitrarily dismissing the employee. Without it he will not be
able to maintain discipline. The two arguments, besides answering
each other, divide the railroad service into hostile camps. The
executive committees of the labor organizations practically cannot
save the members of those organizations from being got rid of,
though they do in many cases protect them against summary discharge;
and, on the other hand, the official, in the face of the executive
committee, enjoys only in theory the power of summary discharge.
The situation is accordingly false and bad. It provokes
hostility. The one party boasts of a protection which he does not
enjoy; the other insists upon a power which he dares not exercise.
The remedy is manifest. A system should be devised based on
recognized facts; a system which would secure reasonable protection
to the employee, and at the same time enable the official to
enforce all necessary discipline. This a permanent service, with
a properly organized tribunal to appeal to, would bring about.
Meanwhile the winnowing process would be provided for in the
temporary service. Over that the official would have complete
control, and the idle, the worthless, and the insubordinate would
be kept off. The wheat would there be separated from the chaff.
Until such a system is devised the existing chaos, made up of
powerless protection and impotent power, must apparently continue.
None the less it is a delusion on the one side and a mockery
on the other.</p>

<p>How the members of such a court as has been suggested
would be appointed and by whom is matter for consideration. It
would, of course, be essential that the appointees should command
the confidence of all in the company's service, whether officials or
employees. The possible means of reaching this result will
presently be discussed.</p>

<p>Not only should permanent employees be entitled to retain
their position during good behavior, but they should also look
forward to the continual bettering of their condition. That is,
apart from promotion, seniority in the service should carry with
it certain rights and privileges. Take the case of conductors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
brakemen, engineers, machinists, and the like; there seems to be
no reason why length of faithful service should not carry with it a
stipulated increase of pay. If conductors, for example, have a
regular pay of $100 a month, there seems no good reason why
the pay should not increase by steps of $5 with each five years'
service, so that when the conductor has been twenty-five years in
the service his pay should be increased by one-quarter, or $25 a
month. The increase might be more or less. The figures suggested
merely illustrate. So also with the engineer, the brakeman,
the section-man, the machinist. A certain prospect of increased
pay, if a man demeans himself faithfully, is a great incentive
to faithful demeanor. This is another fact which it would
be well not to lose sight of.</p>

<p>There ought likewise to be connected with every large railroad
organization certain funds, contributed partly by the company
and partly by the voluntary action of employees, which would provide
for hospital service, retiring pensions, sick pensions, and insurance
against accident and death. Every man whose name has
once been enrolled in the permanent employ of the company
should be entitled to the benefit of these funds; and he should be
deprived of it only by his own voluntary act, or as the consequence
of some misdemeanor proved before a tribunal. At present the
railroad companies of this country are under no inducement to
establish these mutual insurance societies, or to contribute to them.
Their service, in principle at least, is a shifting service; and so
long as it is shifting the elaborate organizations which are essential
to the safe management of the funds referred to cannot be
called into existence. A tie-up, as it might be called, between the
companies and their employees is a condition precedent. Were
this once effected the rest would follow by steps both natural and
easy. For a company like the Union Pacific to contribute $100,000
a year to a hospital fund and retiring pension and insurance
associations would be a small matter, if the thing could be so
arranged that the permanent employees themselves would contribute
a like sum; and permanent employees only would contribute
at all. Once let the growth of associations like these begin,
and it proceeds with almost startling rapidity. At the end of ten
years the accumulated capital on the basis of contribution suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
would probably amount to millions. Every man who was
so fortunate as to become a permanent employee of the company
would then be assured of provision in case of sickness or disability,
and his family would be assured of it in case of his death.</p>

<p>The moment a permanent service was thus established it would
also involve further provision of an educational nature. That is,
the companies must continually provide a stock of men for the
future. Where a boy&mdash;the son of an employee&mdash;grows up always
looking forward to entering the company's service, he becomes to
that company very much what a cadet at West Point or Annapolis
is to the army or the navy of the United States; the idea of
loyalty to the company and of pride in its service grows up with
him. Railroad educational institutions of this sort have already
been created by at least one corporation in the country, and they
should be created by all railroad corporations of the first class.
The children of employees would naturally go into these schools,
and the best of them would at the proper age be sent out upon
the road to take their places in the shops, on the track, or at the
brake. From those thus educated the higher positions in the
company would thereafter be filled. The cost of maintaining
these schools, at least in part, would become a regular item in the
operating expenses of the road. Properly handled, a vast economy
would be effected through them. The morale of the service would
gradually be raised, and the morale of a railroad is, if properly
viewed, no less important than the morale of an army or navy. It
is invaluable.</p>

<p>But it is futile to suppose that such a service as that outlined
could be organized, in America at least, unless those concerned in
it were allowed a voice in its management. Practically the most
important feature of the whole is therefore yet to be considered.
How is the employee to be assured a voice in the management
of these joint interests, without bringing about demoralization?
No one has yet had the courage to face this question; and yet it
is a question which must be faced if a solution of existing difficulties
is to be found. If the employees contribute to the insurance
and other funds, it is right that they should have a voice in the
management of those funds. If an employee holds his situation
during good behavior, he has a right to be heard in the organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
of the board which, in case of his suspension for alleged
cause, is to pass upon his behavior. No system will succeed
which does not recognize these rights. In other words, it will be
impossible to establish perfectly good faith and the highest
morale in the service of the companies until the problem of giving
this voice to employees, and giving it effectively, is solved. It
can be solved in but one way: that is, by representation. To
solve it may mean industrial peace.</p>

<p>It is, of course, impossible to dispose of these difficult matters
in town-meeting. Nevertheless, the town-meeting must be at the
base of any successful plan for disposing of them. The end in
view is to bring the employer&mdash;who in this case is the company,
represented by its president and board of directors&mdash;and the employees
into direct and immediate contact through a representative
system. When thus brought into direct and immediate contact,
the parties must arrive at results through the usual method:
that is, by discussion and rational agreement. It has already been
noticed that the operating department of a great railroad company
naturally subdivides itself into those concerned in the train movement,
those concerned in the care of the permanent way, and those
concerned in the work of the mechanical department. It would
seem proper, therefore, that a council of employees should be
formed, of such a number as might be agreed on, containing representatives
from each of these departments. In order to make
an effective representation, the council would have to be a large
body. For present purposes, and for the sake of illustration
merely, it might be supposed that, in the case of the Union Pacific,
each department in a division of the road would elect its own
members of the employees' council. There are five of these divisions
and three departments in every division. The operating-men,
the yard and section-men, and the machinists of the division
would, therefore, under this arrangement choose a given number
of representatives. If one such representative was chosen to each
hundred employees in the permanent service those thus selected
would constitute a division council. To perfect the organization,
without disturbing the necessary work of the company, each of
these division councils would then select certain (say, for example,
three) of their number, representing the mechanical, the operating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
and the permanent way departments, and these delegates from
each of the departments would, at certain periods of the year, to
be provided for by the articles of organization, all meet together
at the head-quarters of the company in Omaha. The central
council, under the system here suggested, would consist of fifteen
men; that is, one representing each of the three departments of
the five several divisions. These fifteen men would represent the
employees. It would be for them to select a board of delegates,
or small executive committee, to confer directly with the president
and board of directors. Here would be found the organization
through which the voice of the employees would make itself heard
and felt in matters which directly affect the rights of employees,
including the appointment of a tribunal to pass upon cases of misdemeanor,
and the management of all institutions, whether financial
or educational, to which the employees had contributed and
in which they had a consequent interest.</p>

<p>There is no reason whatever for supposing that, within the
limits which have been indicated, such an organization would lead
to difficulty. On the contrary, where it did not remove a difficulty
it might readily be made to open a way out of it. The employees,
feeling that they too had rights which the company frankly
recognized and was bound to respect, would in all cases of agitation
proceed through the regular machinery, which brought them
into easy and direct contact with the highest authority in the
company's service. They would not, therefore, be driven into outside
organizations. Meanwhile, on the other hand, the highest
officers of the company, including the president and the board of
directors, would be brought into immediate relations with the representatives
of the employees on terms of equality. Each would
have an equal voice in the management of common interests; and
it would only remain to make provision for arriving at a solution
of questions in case of deadlock. This would naturally be done
by the appointment of a permanent arbitrator, who would be
selected in advance.</p>

<p>The organization suggested includes, it will be remembered,
only those employees whose names are on the permanent rolls of
the operating department. For reasons which have been sufficiently
referred to, those whose names are on the rolls of the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
four departments have not been considered. But there would be
no difficulty in making provision for them also, should it be found
expedient or desirable so to do. Through the system of representation
the organization could in fact be made to include every
employee in the permanent service of the company, not excepting
the president, the general manager, or the general counsel. Each
employee included would have one vote, and each division and
department its representatives. The organization in other words
is elastic. No matter how large it might be it would never become
unwieldy so long as it resulted in the small committee which met
in direct conference face to face with the board of directors.</p>

<p>Could such a system as that which has been suggested be
devised and put in practical operation there is reason to hope that
the difficulties which have hitherto occurred between the great
railroad companies and those in their pay would not occur in future.
The movement is the natural and necessary outcome of the vast
development referred to in the opening paragraphs of this paper.
It is based on a simple recognition of acknowledged facts, and follows
the lines of action with which the people of this country are
most familiar. The path indicated is that in which for centuries
they have been accustomed to tread. It has led them out of many
difficulties. Why not out of this difficulty?</p>

<p>
Nearly three years have since elapsed, and the events of the year 1888&mdash;with its strike of engineers
on the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy&mdash;seem to indicate that the relations of railroad employees to the
railroad companies have undergone no material change since the year 1886, when the strike on the
Missouri Pacific took place. The same unsatisfactory condition of affairs apparently continues.
There is a deep-seated trouble somewhere.

No sufficient reason, therefore, exists for longer suppressing this paper. Provided the suggestions

The paper is printed as it was prepared. The figures and statistics contained in it have no application,
therefore, to the present time; nor has it been thought worth while to change them, inasmuch as
they have little or no bearing upon the argument. That is just as applicable to the state of affairs
now as it was to that which existed then. The only difference is that the course of events during the
three intervening years has demonstrated that the paper, if it does no good, will certainly do no harm.

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_383dc.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap">The typical railroad man "runs on the road;" he
is not the one whose urbane presence adorns the
much-heralded offices of the railroad companies on
Broadway, where the gold letters on the front window
are each considerably larger than the elbow-room
allowed the clerks inside; nor, indeed, is he,
generally speaking, the one with whom the public or
the public's drayman comes in contact when visiting
a large city station to ship or receive freight. These and others,
whose part in the complex machinery of transportation is in a degree
auxiliary, are indeed largely imbued with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>
which originates in the main body of workers; but their duties are
such that their interest is not especially lively. Even the men
employed at stations in villages and large towns acquire a share
of their railroad spirit at second hand, as life on a train is necessary
to get the experience which embodies the true fascination
which so charms Young America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>The railroad man's home-life is not specially different from
other people's. There have been Chesterfields among conductors,
and mechanical geniuses have grown up among the locomotive
engineers, but these were products of an era now past. Station-men
are a part of the communities where their duties place
them. Trainmen and their families occupy a modest though
highly respectable place in the society they live in. Trainmen
who live in a city generally receive the same pay that is given to
their brothers, doing the same work, whose homes are in the
country. The families of the latter therefore enjoy purer air, lessened
expenses, and other advantages which are denied the
former.</p>

<p>On most railroads the freight trainmen&mdash;engineers, conductors,
brakemen, and firemen&mdash;are the most numerous and prominent
class, as the number of freight trains is generally larger than
that of passenger trains; and among these men there are more
brakemen than anything else, because there are two or more on
every train, while there is but one of each of the other classes.
And as the ranks of the passenger-train service are generally recruited
from the freight trainmen, it follows that the <em>freight brakeman</em>
impresses his individuality quite strongly upon not only the
circles in which he moves but the whole train-service as well.
Freight conductors are promoted brakemen, and most (though
not by any means all) passenger conductors are promoted freight
conductors; so that the brakeman's prominent traits of character
continue to appear throughout the several grades of the service.
As he is promoted he of course improves. The general character
of the <em>personnel</em> of the freight-train service has undergone a considerable
change in the last twenty years. Whiskey drinkers have
been weeded out, and pilferers with them. Improved discipline
has effected a general toning up, raising the moral standard perceptibly.
One reforming superintendent, a few years ago, on undertaking
an aggressive campaign found himself compelled to discharge
three-fifths of all his brakemen before he could regard the
force as reasonably cleared of the rowdy element.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The brakeman, like the "drummer," is a characteristic American
product. Each has his wits sharpened by peculiar experiences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
and, while important lines of intellectual training are almost
wholly neglected, there is contact with the world in various directions,
which develops qualities that tend to elevate the individual
in many ways. Although freight brakemen do not have any intercourse
with the public, they somehow learn the ways of the
world very quickly, and the brightest ones among them need very
little training to fit them for a place on a passenger train where
they are expected to deal with gentle ladies and fastidious millionaires,
and bear themselves with the grace of a hotel clerk.
Perhaps one reason why brakemen impress their characteristics
on the whole <em>personnel</em> of the service is because they have abundance
of opportunity for meditation. Many of them have a superfluity
of hours and half-hours when they have nothing to do but
ride on the top of a car and keep a general watch of the train, and
they have ample time to think twice before speaking once. Even
a circus clown or the vender of shoestrings or ten-cent watches
has to study the arts of expression; why should not the intelligent
trainman, who wishes to let people know that he is of some account
in the world? If he wants a favor from a superior he knows
just the best way of approach to secure success. If he deems it
worth while to complain of anything, he formulates his appeal in a
way that is sure to be telling. Everyone knows the old story of
the brakeman who was refused a free pass home on Saturday
night with the argument that his employer, if a farmer, could not
be reasonably expected to hitch up a horse and buggy for such a
purpose. The reply that, admitting this, the farmer who had his
team already harnessed up and was going that way with an empty
seat would be outrageously mean to refuse his hired man a ride,
is none too 'cute to be characteristic. The brakeman who is not
able to puncture the sophistries of narrow-souled or disingenuous
superiors is the exception and not the rule.</p>

<p>The brakeman gives the prevailing tone to the "society" of
despatchers' lobbies and other lounging places which he frequents.
If he be profane or fault-finding or sour, he can easily spread the
influence of these unpleasant traits. A lazy brakeman becomes
more lazy, because his work is in many respects easy. Having
little to do he demands still less. A foul-mouthed one gives himself
free rein because many usual restraints are absent. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
prevalence of profanity, which, aside from the question of sinfulness,
hampers a man in any aspirations he may have toward more
elevating society, is perhaps the worst blot on the reputation of
brakemen as a class. Many worthy men among them, and especially
among conductors and engineers, have, however, done much
to improve the tone of conversation in trainmen's haunts, and on
the better disciplined roads decorum is the rule, and rowdyism the
exception. There is abundance of humor and spirit, however. The
brakeman originates whatever slang may be deemed necessary to
give spice to the talk of the caboose and round-house. He calls a
gravel train a "dust express," and refers to the pump for compressing
air for the power-brakes as a "wind-jammer." The fireman's
prosaic labors are lightened by being poetically mentioned as the
"handling of black diamonds," and the mortification of being called
into the superintendent's office to explain some dereliction of duty
is disguised by referring to the episode as "dancing on the carpet."</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_386.jpg" width="350" alt="" />
<div class="caption">"Dancing on the Carpet."</div>
</div>

<p>The disagreeable features of a freight brakeman's life are chiefly
those dependent upon
the weather. If he
could perform his duties
in Southern California
or Florida in
winter, and in the
Northern States in
summer, his lot would
ordinarily be a happy
one, though the annoyance
of tramps is
almost universal in
mild climates, and in
many cases takes the
shape of positive danger.
These vagabonds
persist in riding
on or in the cars, while
the faithful trainman
must, according to his instructions, keep them off. In some sections
of the country they will board a train in gangs of a dozen, armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
with pistols, and dictate where a train shall carry them. Not long
ago in Chicago a conductor, while ejecting a tramp from the caboose,
was shot and killed by the ruffian.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_387.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Trainman and Tramps.</div>
</div>

<p>The hardships of cold and stormy weather are serious, both because
of the test of endurance involved and the added difficulties in
handling a train. The Westinghouse automatic air-brake, which
has served so admirably on passenger trains for the past fifteen
years, has only recently been adapted and cheapened so as to make
it available for long freight trains, but it is now so perfected that
in a few years the brakeman who now has to ride on the outside of
cars in a freezing condition for an hour at a time will be privileged
to sit comfortably in his caboose while the speed of the train is
governed by the engineer through the instantaneous action of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
air-brake. On the steep roads of the Rocky Mountains, and a
few other lines, this brake is already in use.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_389.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Braking in Hard Weather.</div>
</div>

<p>But "braking by hand" is still the rule. In running on ascending
grades or at slow speeds, the brakemen can ride under
cover, but in descending grades, or on levels when the speed is
high, they must be on the tops of the cars ready to instantly apply
the brakes, for the reason that there are generally only three or
four men to a long train weighing from 500 to 1,000 tons, whose
momentum cannot be arrested very quickly. In descending steep
grades, only the most constant and skilful care prevents the train
from rushing at breakneck speed to the foot of the incline, or to a
curve, where it would be precipitated over an embankment and
crushed into splinters. One of the mountain roads in Colorado
which now uses air-brakes is said to be lined its whole length with
the ruins of cars lying in the gorges, where they were wrecked in
the former days of hand-brakes. Even on grades much less steep
than those in Colorado the danger of this sort of disaster is one
that has to be constantly guarded against. Take the case of a
40-car train descending a 1½ per cent. grade (79<sup>2</sup>/<sub>10</sub> feet per mile).
Before all of the cars have passed over the summit and commenced
to descend, the forward part of the train will have increased its velocity
very perceptibly and will thus by its weight exert a strong
pull on the rear portion, "yanking" it very roughly sometimes, and
if one of the couplings between the cars chances to be weak it
breaks, separating the train into two parts. Mishaps of this kind
are frequent, and two or more breakages often occur at the same
time, dividing the train so that one of the parts&mdash;between the two
end portions&mdash;is perhaps left with no brakeman upon it. The
engineman then has the choice of slackening his speed and allowing
the unmanageable cars to violently collide with his portion, or
of increasing his own speed to such a rate that he is soon in danger
of suddenly overtaking a train ahead of him. To avoid this breaking-in-two
the brakemen must be wide awake on the instant and
see that their brakes are tightened before the speed even begins
to elude control. As soon as the whole train has got beyond the
summit, and the speed is reduced to a proper rate by the application
of the brakes on, say, one-third or one-half the cars, it will
perhaps be found that one or two brakes too many have been put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
on and that the train is running
too slowly. Some of them must
then be loosened. Or perhaps some are set so tightly that the
friction heats the wheels unduly or causes them to slide along the
track instead of rolling; then those brakes must be released and
some on other cars applied instead; and all this must be done
(sometimes for an hour) when the temperature is 20 degrees below
zero, or the wind is blowing a gale, just as under more favorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
circumstances. A train moving at 20 miles an hour against a wind
with a velocity of 30 miles increases the latter to 50, so far as the
brakeman is concerned; and if rain or sleet is falling, the force of
it on his hands and face is very severe. If we add to this the danger
attendant upon stepping from one car to another over a gap of
27 to 30 inches, in a dark night, when the cars are constantly moving
up and down on their springs and are swaying to one side or
the other every few seconds, we get some idea of, though we cannot
realize, the sensations that must at such times fill the minds of
the men whose pleasant berth seems so enjoyable on a mild summer's
day. And this is not an overdrawn picture or the worst that
might be given; for rain and snow combined often coat the roofs
of cars so completely and solidly that they are worse than the
smoothest skating-pond, and moving upon them is attended with
danger at every step. Jumping&mdash;it cannot be called walking&mdash;from
one car to another is in such cases positively reckless. The brake-apparatus
will in a snow-storm be coated with ice so rapidly that
vigorous action is required to keep it in working condition. Even
a wind alone, in dry weather, sometimes compels the men to <em>crawl</em>
from one car to another, grasping such projections as they may.
The brakeman who forgets to take his rubber coat and overalls
sometimes suffers severely from sudden changes of temperature.
In spring or fall a lively shower will be encountered in a sheltered
valley, and the clothing be completely drenched, and then within
perhaps half an hour the ascent of a few hundred feet brings the
train into an atmosphere a few degrees below the freezing point, so
that with the aid of the wind, fanned by the speed of the train, the
clothes are very soon frozen stiff.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_391.jpg" width="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Flagging in Winter.</div>
</div>

<p>Another feature which often involves discomfort, and occasionally
positive suffering and danger, is "going back to flag." When
a train is unexpectedly stopped upon the road, the brakeman at
the rear end must immediately take his red flag or lantern and go
back a half-mile or more to give the "stop" signal to the engine-men
of any train that may be following. This rule is sometimes
disregarded in clear weather on straight lines, and is even evaded
by lazy or unfaithful brakemen where the neglect is positively dangerous,
but still many a faithful man has to go out and stand for a
long time in a severe snow-storm or risk his life in walking several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
miles to a station. The record of individual perils and heroisms
in the New York blizzard of March, 1888, are paralleled, or at least
repeated, on a slightly milder scale, by brakemen every winter.
Even in the blizzard country of the Northwest, where a half hour's
exposure is often fatal, the system of train-running is such that
the stopping of a train at an unexpected place involves danger of
collision if the brakeman does not at once go back and <em>stay back</em>.
A "tail-end" brakeman has various anxieties, which cannot be detailed
here. Often there is a possibility that the advancing engineer
will not see his red lantern. One brakeman in New Brunswick
several years ago ignominiously deserted his post, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
his train to look out for itself, because of a visit from a huge bear
whose residence was in the woods near the point on the railroad
where the brakeman
was keeping his lonely
night-vigil.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_392.jpg" width="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Coupling.</div>
</div>

<p>The danger of sudden
accidental death
or maiming is constant
and great, and the
bare record of the numerous
cases is acutely
suggestive of inexpressible
suffering;
but, strange to say, it
does not worry the
average brakeman
much. Though probably a thousand trainmen are killed in this
country every year, and four or five thousand injured, by collisions
and derailments, in coupling cars, falling off trains, striking low
overhead bridges, and from other causes, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'no one brakeman'">not one brakeman</ins>, from
what he sees in his own experience, realizes the danger very vividly.
As in other dangers which are constant but inevitable, familiarity
breeds carelessness which is closely akin to contempt. Falling
from trains is really a serious danger, because the most
ceaseless caution&mdash;next to impossible for the average man to
maintain&mdash;is necessary to avoid missteps. This will be practically
abolished when the long-wished-for air-brake comes into use, as
that will obviate the necessity of riding on the tops of the cars.</p>

<p>Coupling accidents are practically unavoidable because, although
the necessary manipulations <em>can</em> be made without going
between the cars or placing the hands in dangerous situations, the
men as a general thing prefer to take the risk of the more dangerous
method. With the ordinary freight-car apparatus (which,
however, is destined to be superseded by an automatic coupler)
the link by which the cars are connected is retained by a pin in
the drawbar of either car; as one car approaches another at considerable
speed, this link, which hangs loosely down at an angle of
thirty degrees, must be lifted and guided into the opening in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
opposite drawbar. This operation must, according to the regulations
of most roads, be performed by the aid of a short stick; but,
disregarding the regulation, partly to save time and partly because
of fear of the ridicule that would be called out by the exhibition
of a lack of dexterity, the average brakeman uses his fingers.
He must lift the link and hold it horizontally until the end enters
the opening, and then withdraw his hand before the heavy drawbars
come together. A delay of a fraction of a second would
crush the hand or finger as under a trip-hammer. And, in point
of fact, this delay does, for various reasons, frequently happen, and
the number of trainmen with wounded hands to be found in every
large freight-yard is sad evidence of the fact. But again, assuming
that this part of the operation is accomplished in safety, there
is another and worse danger in the possibility of being crushed
bodily. Cars are built with projecting timbers on their ends at or
near the centre, for the purpose of keeping the main body of each
car twelve or fifteen inches from its neighbor; but cars of dissimilar
pattern sometimes meet in such a way that the projections on
one lap past those on the other, and the space which should afford
room for the man to stand in safety is not maintained. If the
brakeman, in the darkness of night or the hurry of his work, fails
to note the peculiarities of the cars, he is mercilessly crushed, the
ponderous vehicles often banging together with a force of many
tons. A constant danger in coupling and uncoupling is the liability
to catch the feet in angles in the track.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Freight conductors
are peculiarly liable to this, as the duty of uncoupling (pulling out
the coupling-pin) generally devolves upon them, and must be
done while the train is in motion. Walking rapidly along, in the
dark, with the right hand holding a lantern and grasping the car,
while the left is tugging at a pin which sticks, involves perplexities
wherein a moment's hesitation may prove fatal.</p>

<p>The dangers here recounted are those which only brakemen
(or those acting as brakemen) have to meet. The liability of all
trainmen to be killed by the cars tumbling down a bank, colliding
with another train, and a hundred other conditions, is also considerable.
The horror which the public feels on the occurrence of
such a disaster as that at Chatsworth, Ill., in the summer of 1887,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
or the half-dozen other terrible ones within the past few years,
could reasonably be repeated every month if railroad employees
instead of passengers were considered. There are no accurate
official statistics kept of the train accidents in the country, but the
accounts compiled monthly by the <cite>Railroad Gazette</cite> always show
a large number of casualties to railroad men from causes <em>beyond
their own control</em> (collisions, running off the track, etc.), no mention
being made of the larger number resulting from the victims'
own want of caution. In the month of March, 1887, in which
occurred the terrible Bussey Bridge disaster, near Boston, 25 passengers
were killed in the United States; but the same month
recorded 34 employees killed. At Chatsworth 80 passengers were
killed; but in that and the following month the number of employees
killed in the country reached 97. In both of these comparisons
the number of passengers is exceptional, while that of
employees is ordinary. But, as already intimated, these dangers
and discouragements are distributed over such a large territory
and among such a large number of individuals that the general
serenity of the brakeman's life is not much disturbed by them. In
spite of them all, he enjoys his work and, if he is adapted to the
calling, he sticks to it.</p>

<div class="caption">The Pleasant Part of a Brakeman's Life.</div>
</div>

<p>The brakeman must be on hand promptly at the hour of his
train's preparation for departure, and generally he must do his
part in 15, 30, or 60 minutes' lively work in assembling cars from
different tracks, changing them from the front to the rear or middle
of the train, and setting aside those that are broken or disabled;
but, once on the road, by far the greater portion of his time
is his own, for his own enjoyment, almost as fully as that of the passenger
who travels for the express purpose of entertaining himself.
In mild weather and in daylight, life on the top of a freight train is
almost wholly devoid of unpleasant features, and it takes on the
nature of work only for the same reason that any routine becomes
more or less irksome after a time. Much of the time there are a
few bushels of cinders from the engine flying in the air, which a
novice can get into his eyes with great facility, but the brakeman
gets used to them. He sees every day (on many roads) the
beauties of nature in great variety. Much of the scenery of the
adjoining country is 500 per cent. more enjoyable from the brakeman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
perch on the roof than from the car windows, for the reason
that the increased height gives such an enlarged horizon. This
education from nature is an element in railroad men's lives not to
be despised. The trainman whose daily trips take him past the
panoramic charms of the Connecticut Valley in summer, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
the gorgeous-hued mountain-foliage along the Erie in autumn, or
the perennial grandeur of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, certainly
enjoys a privilege for which many a city worker would gladly
make large sacrifices. But to trainmen the refining influence of
these surroundings is often an unconscious influence, and with the
majority of them is perhaps generally so, because of the prosaic
round of every-day thoughts filling their minds. There are also
some other advantages, not wholly unæsthetic, which a millionaire
might almost envy the freight trainman. Every twenty miles or
so the engine must stop for water, and it often happens that this
is in a cool place where the men can at the same time refresh
themselves with spring water whose sparkling purity is unknown
in New York or Chicago. Though brakemen who love beer are
not by any means scarce, an accessible spring or well of pure water
along the line always finds appreciative users during warm weather;
and the Kentuckian who sojourned six months in Illinois without
thinking to try the water there is not represented in the ranks of
level-headed brakemen. A certain railroad president regales himself
in summer on spring water brought in jugs from 100 miles
up the road by trainmen who find in this service an opportunity to
"make themselves solid" at headquarters. Freight trainmen get
all the delicious products of the soil at first hands. In their stops
at way-stations they get acquainted with the farmers, and can make
their selection of the best things at low prices, thus (if they keep
house) living on fruits, vegetables, etc., of a quality fit for a king.</p>

<p>The passenger-train brakeman differs from the freight trainman
chiefly in the fact that he must deal with the public, and so
must have a care for his personal appearance and behavior, and in
the fact that he is <em>not a brakeman</em>, the universal air-brake relieving
him of all work in this line. His chief duties are those of a
porter, though the wide-awake American brakeman, with an eye
to future promotion to a conductorship, maintains his dignity and
is not by any means the servile call-boy that the English railway
porter is. The wearing of uniforms has been introduced here from
England and is, in the main, a good feature, though some roads,
whose discipline is otherwise quite good, allow their men to appear
in slovenly and even ragged clothes. Superintendents should give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
more care to this matter, as it is not an unimportant one. It
affects the men's self-respect and influences their usefulness in other
ways. The frugal brakeman cannot
wear his blue suit on Sunday
or a-visiting, and his Sunday
suit when old cannot
be used up by week-day
wear, so he naturally
concludes that his
employer is guilty of a little
undue severity toward him. Brakemen on the modern "limited"
trains (a three hours' run without a stop constituting a day's
work) have in some respects too easy a task, and their minds are
more likely to rust out than to wear out. They have a constant
care, to be sure, and sometimes must "go back to flag," the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
as a freight trainman, but, in the main, their berth would about fill

<p>Brakemen have had the reputation of doing a good deal of
flirting, and many a country-girl has found a worthy husband
among them; but there is not so much of this method of diversion
as formerly; both passenger and freight men now have to attend
more strictly to business, and they cannot conveniently indulge in
side play. There are still, however, enough short branch-lines
and slow-going roads in backwoods districts to insure that flirting
shall not become a lost art in this part of the world.</p>

<p>The freight conductor is simply a high grade of brakeman.
His work is almost wholly supervisory and clerical, and so, after
several years' service, he becomes more sober and business-like in
his bearing, the responsibilities of his position being sufficient to
effect this change; but he generally retains his sympathies with his
old associates who have become subordinates. His duties are to
keep the record of the train, the time, numbers of cars, etc.; to see
that the brakemen regulate the speed when necessary, and to keep
a general watch. The calculations necessary to make a 75-mile
trip and get over the line without wasting time are often considerable,
and an inexperienced conductor can easily keep himself in a
worry for the whole trip. Often he cannot go more than ten miles
after making way for a passenger train before another overtakes
him; so that he must spend a good share of his time sitting in his
caboose with the time-table in one hand and his watch in the other,
calculating where and when to side-track the train. On single-track
roads perplexities of this kind are generally more numerous
than on double lines, because trains both in front and behind must
be guarded against, and because the regulations are frequently
modified by telegraphic instructions from headquarters. A mistake
in reading these instructions, which are written in pencil, often by
a slovenly penman, and on tissue-paper, may, and occasionally does,
cause a disastrous collision. These duties of conductors are especially
characteristic of trains that must keep out of the way of passenger
trains, so that in this particular line it will be seen that
the passenger conductor has much the easier berth. The freight
and "work-train" conductor must really be a better calculator, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
many ways, than the wearer of gilt badges and buttons, though the
latter receives the higher pay.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bête noire</i> of the freight conductor is an investigation at
headquarters concerning delinquencies in which the blame is divided.
A typical case of this kind is that of a freight train which
has stopped at some unusual place and been run into by a following
train, doing some hundreds of dollars damage, if not killing or injuring
persons. "Strict adherence to rules will avert all such
accidents," the code says; but they do happen, and the inquiry as
to whether the conductor used due diligence in sending a man with
a red flag to warn the oncoming train, or the engineer of the
latter was heedless, or what was the trouble, is the occasion of
much anxiety.</p>

<p>Conductors, concerning whose life I have only noted a few of
the duties and perplexities, are not so much subject to the vicissitudes
of cold and wet weather, and therefore have in many respects
better opportunities than the brakemen to avail themselves
of the enjoyments of a trainman's life. The risk to life and limb
from coupling cars, etc., is also somewhat less, though many a
faithful conductor has lost his life in the performance of a dangerous
duty which he had assumed out of generous consideration for
an inexperienced or overworked subordinate. The beneficial influences
on health, mind, and morals coming from contact with nature
are, as before remarked, largely unconscious influences, because
of the counteracting effect of the immediate surroundings.
The irregular hours are unfavorable to health. The crews run in
turn; if there are forty crews and forty trains daily, each crew will
start out at about the same hour each day. But if on Monday
there are forty trains, on Tuesday thirty, and on Wednesday fifty,
it will be seen that the starting time must be very irregular. Ten
of the crews which worked on Monday will have nothing to do on
Tuesday, but on Wednesday or Thursday will have to do double
service. The first trip will be all in the daytime, and the next all
in the night, perhaps. This irregularity is constant, and it is impossible
to tell on Monday morning where one will be on Wednesday.
All the week's sleep may have to be taken in the daytime
or all at night. There may be five days' work to do between
Monday morning and the following Monday morning, or there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
may be nine. The trainman has to literally board in his "mammoth"
dinner-pail, and his wife or boarding mistress knows less
about his whereabouts than if he were on an Arctic whaling vessel.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The locomotive engineer is the popular "hero of the rail," and
the popular estimate in this respect is substantially just. Others
have to brave dangers and perform duties under trying circumstances;
but the engine-runner has to ride in the most dangerous
part of the train, take charge of a steam-boiler that may explode
and blow him to atoms, and of machinery that may break and kill
him, and try to keep up a vigilance which only a being more than
human could successfully maintain. He must be a tolerably skilful
machinist&mdash;he cannot be too good&mdash;and have nerves that will
remain steady under the most trying circumstances. If running a
fast express through midnight darkness over a line where a similar
train has been tipped off a precipice (and a brother runner
killed) by train-wreckers the night before, he must dash forward
with the same confidence that he would feel in broad daylight on
an open prairie. But he does not "heroically grasp the throttle"
in the face of danger, when the throttle has been already shut,
nor does he "whistle down brakes," in order to add a stirring element
to the reporter's tale, when by the magic of the air-brake he
can, with a turn of his hand, apply every brake in the train with
the grip of a vise in less time than it would take him to reach the
whistle-pull. When there is danger ahead there is generally just
one thing to do, and that is to stop as soon as possible. An instant
suffices for shutting off the steam and applying the brake.
With modern trains this is all that is necessary or can be done.
Reversing the engine is necessary on many engines, and formerly
was on all; this would, in fact, be done instinctively by old runners,
in any case, but this also is done in a second. After taking
these measures there is nothing for the engineman to do but look
out for his own safety. In some circumstances, as in the case of
a partially burned bridge which may possibly support the train
even in a weakened condition, it may be best to put on all steam.
The runner is then in a dilemma, and a right decision is a matter
of momentary inspiration. Many lives have been saved by
quick-witted runners in such cases, but there is no ground for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
censure of the engineer who, in the excitement of the moment, decides
to slacken instead of quicken his speed. The rare cases of
this kind are what show the value of experience, and of men of
the right temperament and degree of intelligence to acquire experience-lessons
readily. The writer recalls an instance several
years ago where an alert, steady, and experienced runner found
himself on the crossing of another railroad with a heavy train rushing
toward him on the transverse track at uncontrollable speed.
It was too late to retreat, and in less than ten seconds the oncoming
train would crash broadside into his cars, filled with passengers.
A frantic effort to increase the speed and clear the crossing
would have either broken the weak couplings then in use or
would have simply whirled the driving-wheels with such excessive
force as to slacken the speed of the train rather than accelerate it.
In point of fact, the rear car just escaped being struck by the ponderous
engine bearing down upon it at the rate of twenty or thirty
feet a second; and the preservation of the lives of the passengers
was due to the fact that the engineer was well-balanced, quick to
act, and not excitable. What did he do? He instantly put on
more steam, but with unerring judgment opened the valve just far
enough and no more.</p>

<p>But the terrible cloud constantly hanging over the engineer and
fireman of a fast train is the chance of encountering an obstacle
which cannot possibly be avoided, and which leaves them no alternative
but to jump for their lives, if, indeed, it does not take away even
that. To the fact that this cloud is no larger than it is, and that
these men have sturdy and courageous natures, must be attributed
the lightness with which it rests upon them. On one road or another,
from a washout, or inefficient management, or a collision
caused by an operator's forgetfulness, or some one of a score of
other causes, there are constantly occurring cases of men heroically
meeting death under the most heart-rending circumstances.
Every month records a number of such, though happily they are
not frequent on any one road. The case of Engineer Kennar, a
year or more ago, is a typical one. Precipitated with his engine
into a river by a washout which the roadmaster's vigilance had
failed to discover, his first thought, as zealous hands tried to rescue
him, was for the safety of his train; and, forgetting his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
anguish, he warned those about him to attend first to the sending
of a red lantern to warn a following train against a collision. The
significance of facts like this is not so much in the service to humanity
done at the time, or even in the example set for those who
shall meet such crises in the future, but rather in the evidence they
give of the firm and lofty conscientiousness that inspires the every-day
conduct of thousands of engineers all over the land. As has
already been said, the critical occasions on which engineers are
supposed to be heroic often allow them no chance at all to be
either heroic or cowardly, and their heroism must be, and is, manifested
in the calm fidelity with which they, day after day and year
after year, perform their exacting and often monotonous round of
duties while all the time knowing of the possibilities before them.</p>

<p>On the best of roads a freight train wrecked by a broken wheel
under a borrowed car may be thrown in the path of a passenger
train on another track, just as the latter approaches. This has
happened more than once lately. No amount of fidelity or forethought
(except in the maker of the wheels) can prevent this kind
of disaster. There is constant danger, on most roads, of running
off the track at misplaced switches, many switches being located
at points where the runner can see them only a few seconds before
he is upon them; but the chance is so small&mdash;perhaps one in ten
or a hundred thousand&mdash;that the average runner forgets it, and it
is only by severe self-discipline that he can hold himself up to compliance
with the rule which requires him to be on the watch for
every switch-target as long before reaching it as he possibly can.
He finds the switches all right and the road perfectly clear so regularly,
day after day and month after month, that he may easily
fall into the snare of thinking that they will always be so. But,
like other trainmen, the engineman finds enough more agreeable
thoughts to fill his mind, and reflects upon the hazards of his vocation
perhaps too little.</p>

<div class="caption">Just Time to Jump.</div>
</div>

<p>The freight engineman's every-day thoughts are largely about
the care of his engine and the perplexities incident to getting out
of it the maximum amount of work with the minimum amount of
fuel. The constant aim of his superiors is to have the engine draw
every pound it possibly can. To haul a train up a long and steep
grade when the cars are so heavily loaded that a single additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
one would bring the whole to a dead stand-still requires a knack
that can be appreciated only by viewing the performance on the
spot. Failure not only wastes
time and fuel (it may necessitate
a return to the foot
of the hill or going to
the top with only
half the load), but
it raises a suspicion
that some other
runner might
have succeeded
better. The runner
whose engine
"lays down on the
road" (fails to draw
its load because of
insufficient fire and
consequent low
steam-pressure) is
liable to the jeers of his comrades on his return home, if not to
some sharp inquiries from his superior.</p>

<p>The passenger runner's greatest concern is to "make time."
Some trains are scheduled so that the engineman must keep his locomotive
up to its very highest efficiency over every furlong of its
journey in order to arrive at his destination on time. A little carelessness
in firing, in letting cold water into the boiler irregularly, or
in slackening more than is necessary where the right to the track is
in doubt for a few rods; these and a score of similar circumstances
may make five minutes' delay in the arrival at the terminus and
necessitate an embarrassing interview with the trainmaster. A
trip on a crowded line may involve watching for danger-signals
every quarter of a mile and the maintenance of such high speed
that they must be obeyed the instant they are espied in order to
avoid the possibility of collision.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>The passenger runner finds himself now and then with a disabled
engine on his hands, and two or three hundred passengers
standing around apparently ready to eat him up if he does not
remedy the difficulty in short order. Often in such cases he is in
doubt himself whether the repairs necessary to enable his engine
to proceed will occupy fifteen minutes or an hour. This, with
the knotty question of where the nearest relief engine is, causes
the brow to knit and the sweat to start, and to the young runner
proves an experience which he long remembers.</p>

<p>Stories of fast running are common but unreliable; and when
truthful, important considerations are often omitted. There are
so many elements to be considered, that usually the verdict can be
justly rendered only after a careful comparison with previous records.
Most regular runs include a number of stops, and are subject
to numerous slackenings of the speed, thus dimming the lustre
of the record of the trip as a whole. Frequently, quick runs which
have been reported as noteworthy have had favoring circumstances
not told of. The most remarkable single run on record was that
of Jarrett &amp; Palmer's special train chartered to carry their theatrical
company from New York to San Francisco (Jersey City to
Oakland), June 1&ndash;4, 1876, which is well known to all Americans.
Perhaps the fastest long run ever made in this country was that of
a special train over the West Shore Railroad from East Buffalo to
Frankfort, N. Y., two hundred and one miles, on July 9, 1885,
which ran this distance in four hours, including several stops.
This train ran thirty-six miles in thirty minutes, and ran many single
miles in forty-three seconds each. An engine with two cars ran
over the Canada Southern Division of the Michigan Central from
St. Clair Junction to Windsor, Ont., on November 16, 1886, a distance
of one hundred and seven miles, in ninety-seven minutes;
and this included two or three stops. The average rate of speed
was about sixty-nine miles an hour, and in places it rose to seventy-five
and over. The engineers and their firemen, and all connected
with the handling of the trains, certainly deserve credit for performances
like these, and they receive it; but the supplying of the
perfect machine, the smooth and safe roadway comparatively clear
of other trains, and other conditions, is so manifestly beyond their
control, while at the same time constituting such an important factor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
in the result, that praise should be given discriminatingly. An
engineer who makes a specially quick trip feels proud of his engine,
and of the honor of having been chosen for an important run,
and he shares with the passengers the exhilaration produced by
such a triumph of science and skill in annihilating space; but in
the matter of credit to himself for experience and judgment, patience
and forethought, he feels and knows that many a trip in his
every-day service is worthy of greater recognition. Many a runner
has to urge his engine, day after day, with a load twenty-five per
cent. heavier than it was designed for, over track that is fit only
for low speeds, at a rate which demands the most constant care.
He must run fast enough over the better portions of the track to
allow of slackening where prudence demands slackening. The
tracks of many roads are rendered so uneven by the action of
frost in winter that with an unskilful runner the passengers would
be half-frightened by the unsteady
motion of the cars.
This condition is not common
on the important trunk-lines,
of course; but it does prevail
on roads that carry a great
many passengers, nevertheless;
and engineers who
guide trains over such difficult
journeys, gently luring
the passengers, with the aid
of the excellent springs under
the cars, into the belief
that they are riding over a
track of uniform smoothness,
should not be forgotten in
any estimate of the fraternity
as a whole.</p>

<p>The engineer whose humanity
is not hardened has
his feelings harrowed occasionally by pedestrians who risk their
lives on the track. Tramps and other careless persons are so numerous
that the casual passenger in a locomotive cab generally cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
ride fifty miles without seeing what seems to him a hair-breadth
escape, but which is nevertheless treated by the engineer as a commonplace
occurrence. These heedless wayfarers do, however, occasionally
carry their indifference to danger too far, and they are
tossed in the air like feathers.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Doubtless there are those who,
like the fireman who talked with the tender-hearted young lady,
regret the killing of a man chiefly "because it musses up the engine
so;" but, taking the fraternity as a whole, warmth of heart
and tenderness of feeling may be called not only well-developed
but prominent traits of character. The great strike on the Chicago,
Burlington &amp; Quincy road in 1888, which proved to have been
ill-advised, would have been possible only in a body of men actuated
by the most loyal friendship. Undoubtedly a large conservative
element in the Brotherhood of Engineers believed the move
injudicious, but they joined in it out of an intense spirit of fidelity
to their brethren and leaders.</p>

<img src="images/i_409.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">The Passenger Conductor.</div>
</div>

<p>The passenger-train conductor has in many respects the most
difficult position in the railroad ranks. He should be a first-class
freight conductor and a polished gentleman to boot. But in his
long apprenticeship on a freight train he has very likely been
learning how <em>not</em> to fulfil the additional requirements of a passenger
conductorship. In that service he could be uncouth and
even boorish, and still fill his position tolerably well; now he feels
the need of a life-time of tuition in dealing with the diverse phases
of human nature met with on a passenger train. He must now
manage his train in a sort of automatic way, for he has his mind
filled with the care of his passengers and the collection of tickets.
He must be good at figures, keeping accounts, and handling
money, though the freight-train service has given him no experience
in this line. Year by year the clerical work connected with
the taking up of tickets and collecting of cash fares has been increased
until now, on many roads, an expert bank clerk would be
none too proficient for the duties imposed. The conductor who
grumblingly averred that "it would take a Philadelphia lawyer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
with three heads" to fill his shoes was not far out of the way.
Every day, and perhaps a number of times a day, he must collect
fares of fifty or a hundred persons in less time than he ought to
have for ten. Of that large number a few will generally have a
complaint to make, or an objection to offer, or an impudent assertion
concerning a fault of the railroad company which the conductor
cannot remedy and is not responsible for. A woman will
object to paying half-fare for a ten-year-old girl or to paying full
rates for one of fifteen. A person whose income is ten times
larger than he deserves will argue twenty minutes to avoid paying
ten cents more (in cash) than he would have been charged for a
ticket. Passengers with legitimate questions to ask will couch
them in vague and backhanded terms, and those with useless ones
will take inopportune times to propound them. These are not occasional
but every-day experiences. The very best and most intelligent
people in the community (excepting those who travel much)
are among those who oftenest leave their wits at home when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
take a railroad trip. All these people must be met in a conciliatory
manner, but without varying the strict regulations in the least
degree. The officers of the revenue department are inexorable
masters, and passengers offended by alleged uncivil treatment are
likely to make absurd complaints at the superintendent's office. A
conductor dreads an investigation of this sort, however unreasonable
the passengers' complaints may be, because it may tend to
show that he lacked tact in handling the case. But after becoming
habituated to this sort of dealings, there are still left the occasional
disturbances which no amount of philosophy can make
pleasant. These are the encounters with drunken and disorderly
passengers. The conductor, starting at the forward end of his
train, finds, perhaps, in the first car one or two "toughs" who refuse
payment of fare and are spoiling for a fight. Care must be
taken with this sort of character not to punish him or use the least
bit of unnecessary severity, for he will, when sobered off, quite
likely be induced by a sharp lawyer to sue the railroad company
for damages by assault. The conductor, however, if he be one
who has (in his freight-train experience) dealt with tramps, is able
to cope with his customer and confine him to the baggage-car or
put him off the train. But a tussle of this kind is at best far from
soothing to the temper, and the very next car may contain the
wife of a nabob, who will expect the most genteel treatment
and critically object to any behavior on the part of the conductor
which is not fully up to the highest drawing-room standard. Experiences
of this kind, it can be readily imagined, are exceedingly
trying. The conductor cannot give himself up completely to learning
gentility, for he still has need for his old severity.</p>

<p>The difficulty of always finding the ideal person when wanted
has led to the employment of men of good address who have had
little or no training on freight trains; so that we find some conductors
who are able to deal with all sorts of passengers with a
good degree of success, but who are far from brilliant as managers
of trains, technically speaking; while others, who from their early
experience have first-class executive ability, are slow in discarding
the somewhat rough habits of the freight train. While there are
not wanting those who strive faithfully to reach the ideal, and succeed
admirably, it may be said that the average conductor retains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
more of the severe than of the gentle side of his character, at least
so far as outward behavior goes. The rigid requirements of his
financial superiors, which compel him to actually fight for his
rights with dishonest and stingy passengers, make it almost impossible
that he should be otherwise. Ignorant foreigners, poor
women and girls who have lost their way, and other unfortunates
are, however, encountered often enough to preclude the conductor's
forgetting how to be compassionate.</p>

<p>The heroic element is not wholly lacking in the conductor's
life. The temporary guardianship of several hundred people is an
important trust even in smooth sailing, but the conductor's possibilities
are entirely different from the engineer's. He has so much
to do to attend to the petty wants of passengers that their remoter
but more important interests are not given much thought.
The anxieties of a hundred nervous passengers who terribly
dread the loss of an hour by a missed connection are much more
likely to weigh down a conductor's mind than any thoughts of his
duty to them in a possible emergency that will happen only once
in five years. And yet the last-mentioned contingency is a real
one. Only last year, in the great Eastern blizzard, conductors
risked their lives in protecting their passengers. One spent
three or four hours in travelling a mile and a half to a telegraph-office;
in consequence of the six feet of snow, the blinding storm,
and the darkness, he had to constantly hug a barbed-wire fence to
avoid losing his way, and was on the point of exhaustion when
he reached the station.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The term "station-agent" means, practically, the person in
charge of a small or medium-sized station. When one of these
men is promoted to the charge of a large city station, either
freight or passenger, he becomes really a local superintendent,
his duties then consisting very largely in the supervision of an
army of clerks and laborers who must, each in his place, be as
capable as the agent himself. The agent at a small station has
a great multiplicity of duties to perform. He must sell tickets,
be a good book-keeper, and a faithful switch-tender. He generally
must be a telegraph-operator and must be vigorous physically.
He must be ready, like the conductor, to submit to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
abuse from ill-bred customers, and should be the peer of the business
men of his town. He often encounters almost as great a
variety of knotty problems as the superintendent himself, though
he has the advantage that he can generally turn them over to a
superior if he feels unequal to them. The practical difficulties
that most beset him are those incident to doing everything in a
hurry. People who buy tickets wait until the train is about to
start before presenting themselves at the office. Then the agent
has a dozen other things to attend to, and must therefore detect
counterfeit ten-dollar bills with the expertness of a Washington
treasury-clerk. Just as a train reaches his station the train despatcher's
click is heard on the wires, and he must drop everything
and receive (for the conductor) a telegram in which an error
of a single word would very likely involve the lives of passengers.
At a very small station the checking of baggage devolves on the
agent, his overburdened back being thus loaded with one more
straw. He is in many cases agent for the express company, and
so must count, seal, superscribe, and way-bill money packages
and handle oyster-kegs and barrels of beer at a moment's notice.
Women with wagon-loads of loose household effects to go by
freight, and shippers of car-loads of cattle, for which a car must be
specially fitted up, will appear just as the distracted station-man is
receiving a telegram with one side of his brain and selling a ticket
with the other. The household goods must be weighed and
tagged, the sewing-machine tied up, and tables repaired; the
cattle-shipper must be given a short lecture on the legal bearings
of the bargain for transportation which he is about to make, and his
demand that his live-stock shall be carried 500 miles more quickly
than human animals are taken over the same road is to be gently
repressed. It is not every day that a small station is enlivened
by this sort of excitement, yet it is common, and is familiar to
every station agent. The variety in the duties of this position is,
however, a great advantage to the ambitious young man, because
it serves to give him a good lift toward a valuable business education.
He can learn about the methods and knacks and tricks of
many different kinds of business, and can profit by the knowledge
thus gained. Thomas J. Potter, the lately deceased vice-president
of the Union Pacific Railway, whose memory it is proposed to perpetuate
by a bronze statue, began his railroad career as agent at a
small station in Iowa. Others of equal ability and perfection of
character have risen from similar places and by the same means.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>The agent at a small station catches his breath between trains.
There is then generally ample time for calming the nerves and preparing
for the next onslaught. If he is a telegraph-operator he
can chat with the operators at other stations&mdash;a common resource
if the wires are not occupied with more important affairs. In the
class periodicals of operators and railroad men, reference to this
phase of their life may be constantly seen, and incidents of even
romantic interest are not infrequent. Many of the men at small
stations are young and unmarried, while at places where the business
has increased enough to warrant the employment of an assistant,
a young woman to do the telegraphing is frequently the first
helper engaged. With this combination it is unnecessary to tell
what follows. If iron bars and stone walls are things which Cupid
holds in contempt, an electric telegraph wire is the thing
which makes him "snicker right out," if we may use the language
of the circus ring. A distance of 100 miles, instead of
being a barrier, is, under these circumstances, an advantage.
There is, to be sure, a slight disadvantage in the fact that any
tender communication confided to the wires will be liable to fall on
the ears of unfeeling persons at intermediate offices, but the overcoming
of this obstacle provides the agreeable incidental excitement
which is always necessary in genuine love-making. Young
persons (or old, either) can study each other's characters, in important
phases at least, at a distance better than at short range.
The telegraphic mode of sending communications discloses one's
disposition far better than does handwriting. Working on the
same wire with another for a few months enables one to form judgments
of that other's generosity or narrowness, serenity or excitability,
industry or laziness, refinement or boorishness, kindliness of
heart or otherwise, which are quite sure to be correct judgments.
Judgments ripen into attachments, and romances of the wire are
common.</p>

<p>At the railroad station next larger in size, the work is more
divided. One man sells tickets, another attends to the freight
office, another to the baggage, and so on. The ticket-seller must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
make five-cent bargains with the same urbanity that is given to a
$100 trade, and must be able to toss off the latter in two minutes
if occasion requires, or to spend an hour in helping the passenger
choose the best route among a score of possible ones. The <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'fusilade'">fusillade</ins>
of questions that must be met by the ticket-seller every time he
opens his window is familiar to everyone who has ever watched a
place of the kind for ten minutes. The inexperienced traveller
wants to be fully posted as to the exact hour of departure of a tri-weekly
stage with which he is to connect at a railroad station a thousand
miles away, and the more intelligent ones demand an oral
time-table covering the trains for the ensuing week on all railroads
within a radius of 50 miles. Those who cannot read or understand
the time-tables are too modest to ask aid, and their misfortune is
disclosed only after their train has gone and they are found in
tears; while those who can read the table ignore it and ask questions
simply to be sociable.</p>

<p>The station baggage-master has an important but rather thankless
place. He must handle 200-pound trunks with as much ease
as though they contained feathers, and, if he break a moulding off
one, must meet the reproaches
of the owner, who imagines that
the time available for handling
the trunk was five minutes instead
of two seconds. He must
handle much dirty and otherwise
unpleasant stuff, and on the
whole pursue a very unpoetic
life. He has little to do with
train-handling, but he "keeps in
with" the trainmen and furnishes
them with a share of their entertainment.
They lounge in
his room sometimes and he
keeps on tap a supply of jokes
such as that about the new brakeman
who sent to headquarters for a supply of red oil for his red
lantern, and the engineer who lost time with an excursion train on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
the Fourth of July because the extremely hot weather had elongated
the rails and thus materially increased the distance to be travelled
over. When "hot boxes" (friction-heated axles) are given as the
cause of a delay the real cause of which is concealed (by the conductor
who is ashamed of it), the baggage-master gently punctures the
deception by suggesting that perhaps a hot <em>fire</em>-box (in the engine)
is what is meant. Whether the roguish clerk of an inexperienced
general manager, who slyly induced his chief to issue an order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
station agents directing that "all freight cars standing for any
length of time on side tracks must be occasionally moved a short
distance in order to prevent flattening of the wheels," had formerly
been a baggage-master, history does not state.</p>

<p>The switch-tender, whose momentary carelessness has many a
time caused terrible disaster, but whose constant faithfulness outweighs
a million-fold even that painful record, is one of the essential
figures around a station. Nothing but eternal vigilance will
suffice to keep switches always in safe position, and the conscientious
custodian of these always possible death-traps often takes his
burden of care to his pillow. The mishaps which do occur strikingly
illustrate the practical impossibility of holding the human
brain always to the highest pitch. A conductor in New Jersey
(trainmen have to set switches at many places where no switchmen
are employed) recently caused a slight collision by misplacing a
switch, and on seeing the consequences exclaimed, "I deserve to
be discharged; my mistake was inexcusable." And yet an honest
man of that type is the kind demanded for such a place. The
interlocking of switches and signals (the arrangement in a frame
of the levers moving the switches and those moving signals in
such a way that the signal which tells the engineer to come on
<em>cannot be given</em> until the switch is actually in proper position) is one
of the notable improvements of the last twenty years, and is a great
boon to switchmen, as well as to passengers and the owners of railroads.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
By the aid of this apparatus and its distant signals, connected
by wire ropes, the switchman's anxieties are reduced immeasurably.
By concentrating the levers of a number of switches
in a single room one man can do the work of several, and to the
looker-on the perplexities of the position seem to have been increased
instead of diminished. But the switchman's task now is of
a different sort. Under the old plan he was constantly on guard
lest he make a mistake and throw an engine or car off the track.
Under the new, his calculations are chiefly about saving time and
facilitating the work of the trainmen. Questions of danger rarely
come up, being provided against by the perfection of the machinery.
By long familiarity with the ground and the ways of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
handling the trains, the switch-tender in an "interlocking tower"
is enabled to safely conduct a score of trains through a labyrinth
of switches in the time that the novice would take to make the first
move for a single train. Without this admirable apparatus, and
skilful and experienced attendants, the business of great stations
like the Grand Central at New York would be impossible in the
space allowed.</p>

<p>One of the habitués of every station is the section-master, who
looks after three, five, or ten miles of track and a gang of from five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
to twenty-five men who keep it in repair. He is not much seen,
because he is out on the road most of the time; and his duties are
not of a kind that the reader could study, on paper, to much advantage;
but he deserves mention because his place is a really important
one. Railroad tracks cannot be made, like a bridge, five
times as strong as is necessary, and thus a large margin be allowed
for deterioration; they must be constantly watched to see
that they do not fall even a little below their highest standard.
This care-taking can be intrusted only to one who has had long
experience at the work. In violent rain-storms the trackman must
be on duty night and day and patrol the whole length of his division
to see that gravel is not washed over the track or out from
under it. Though roughly dressed and sunburnt, he is an important
personage in the eye of the engineer of a fast express train,
and if he be the least bit negligent, even to the extent of letting a
few rails get a quarter of an inch lower than they ought to, he
hears a prompt appeal from the engine-runner. The latter could
not feel the confidence necessary to guide his 50-ton giant over the
road at lightning speed with its precious human freight if he had
not a trusty trackman every few miles; and passengers who feel
like expressing gratitude for a safe railroad journey should never
forget this unseen guardian.</p>

<p>A number of classes of men in the railroad service must be
turned off with a word for lack of space. The train despatcher,
with his constant burden of care, deserves a chapter. The locomotive
fireman, who has not been directly alluded to, is practically
an apprentice to the engineer, and, like apprentices in some other
callings, has a good deal of hard work to do. He generally has
longer hours than the engineer, as he has to clean a portion of the
polished brass- and iron-work of the engine. He has to throw into
the fire-box several tons of coal a day, and gets so black that his
best friends would not know him when washed up. Those who
begin young and are intelligent, and conserve their strength, are
at length promoted to be engineers. The fireman's twin brother
is the "hostler," who is employed at the larger termini to get the
iron horse out of its stable, lead it to the watering place and feed-trough
(coal-bin), and harness it to the train.</p>

<p>The clerk in the freight office has almost as much variety of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
work as the ticket-seller, and is by no means a mere book-keeper.
The workmen at the freight station are not common
laborers. Their work requires peculiar skill and experience, and
they have diversions worth telling
of, if there were space. The
men in the shops, and those who
go out with derricks and chains
to pick up wrecks, are an important
class by themselves, and
bridge-builders, gate-tenders,
and various others bring up the
rear.</p>

<p>In conclusion, railroad men
as a body are industrious, sober
when at work, and lively when
at play, using well-trained minds,
in their sphere, and possessing
capacity for a high degree of
further training. The public is
not without its duty toward the
million or so of men in the railroad service. The liability to death
or maiming from accident is such a real factor in railroad men's
lives that the public, and especially shareholders in railroads, are
bound to not only uphold officers in providing every possible appliance
and regulation for safety, but to demand the introduction
of such devices. Some of the State railroad commissioners have
done and are doing noble service in this direction, and should be
vigorously supported by their constituencies. The demands of
the public, re-enforced by the exigencies of competition, have made
Sunday trains in many localities almost as common as on week-days,
so that many train and station men work seven days in the
week. In addition to this, holidays oftener increase their work
than diminish it, so that there is room for a considerable reform
in this regard.</p>

<div class="caption">A Little Relaxation.</div>
</div>

<p>The general moral welfare of railroad men has received much
attention in late years, and affords a wide field for work by all who
will. Many railroads have co-operated with the Young Men's
Christian Association branches, started by a few of the employees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
in building and equipping reading-rooms, libraries, etc., and the
companies give many hundred dollars annually toward the support
of these resorts, which serve to keep many a young trainman away
from loafing places of a questionable
character or worse. Mr.
Cornelius Vanderbilt, whose millions
came largely out of the profits
of the New York Central &amp;
Hudson River Railroad, has set
a good example to other railroad
millionaires in the erection of a
building for the employees of that
road in New York City, whose
luxuriousness is an evidence that
he loves his neighbor as himself,
even if that neighbor be a plain
brakeman earning but low wages.
That the resorts provided for railroad men are appreciated is evidenced
by their records. Of the trainmen who regularly come
into the Grand Central Station in New York, 46 per cent. are
members of the Association occupying the building given by Mr.
Vanderbilt, and 65 per cent. make use of the rooms more or less
regularly. Rooms in numerous other cities also make encouraging
showings.</p>

<p>Railroad officers, with their great advantages for enlightenment,
owe it to themselves and their men to see that the thousands
under them have fair opportunities for rising in the world,
and that the owners of the immense corporations which stand as
masters of such vast armies fully understand their measure of responsibility
in the premises. Science and invention, machinery
and improved methods, have effected great changes in the railroad
art, but the American nation, which travels more than any other,
still recognizes the fact that faithful and efficient <em>men</em> are an essential
factor in the prosecution of that art. People desire to deal
with a personality, and therefore wish to see the <em>personnel</em> of the
railroad service fostered and perfected.</p>

<p>The most prominent fact is impressed by the very long line
representing the mileage of the United States. A second impressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
fact is that the United States has more than six times the
mileage of any other country. A third, that there are but five
other countries that have even a tenth as much railway.</p>


<h3 class="fs70">RAILWAY MILEAGE OF THE UNITED STATES.</h3>

<p><em>Total Annual Mileage and Increase.</em>&mdash;On <a href="#Page_429">page 429</a> is given
a chart which, beginning with the 23 miles of 1830 and ending
with the 156,082 miles of 1888, delineates our ever-increasing
total mileage. It also portrays the fluctuations in the number of
miles built annually. This latter study is the more interesting,
especially during the last twenty-five years, which cover the periods
of extreme activity.</p>

<p><em>Mileage Compared with Area.</em>&mdash;The shaded map on the same
page pictures the railway mileage of each State as compared with
its total area. The eleven States bearing the deepest shade (5)
are those having the larger proportions of mileage to area. Of
these, New Jersey stands first, having almost exactly one-fourth of
a mile of railroad for each square mile of land. The proportion of
total area occupied by this mileage is measured to the eye by the
accompanying diagram.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_426.jpg" width="200" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Mileage to Area in New Jersey.</div>
</div>

<p>The entire square stands for one square mile of land, and the
space at the upper left-hand corner stands for that part of the
square mile which the railroad occupies, counting from fence to
fence on each side of the road. This comparison
is made on the basis of one hundred
feet for the "right of way" (the
width allowed in government grants), and
is useful in connection with the study of
the historical maps, especially those of
1880 and 1889, on which the area of some
of the States seems to be nearly all taken
up with roads, owing to the small scale of
the maps. Iowa has the smallest proportion
of any in Group 5. The figures show her proportion to be a
little over one-seventh of a mile of road to one square mile of area.
(Nevada has the smallest proportion of all the States and Territories,
viz., a trifle over <sup>1</sup>/<sub>117</sub> of a mile of line to one square mile.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>That part of the map bearing the deepest shade shows at a
glance that an unbroken belt, averaging some two hundred miles
wide, stretching from Cape Cod to beyond the Mississippi River,
is that part of the country best supplied with railways.</p>

<p>The lighter shades grouped on either side of this belt show
how the mileage grades away north and south.</p>


<h3 class="fs70">GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF RAILWAYS.</h3>

<p>On pages 430 to 433 is a series of historical maps showing
the location of railway lines at each census-year from 1830 to
1880, and in 1889. Charts comparing and ranking the mileage
by States accompany the maps of 1870, 1880, and 1889. These
maps and charts give a better idea of the location and extent of
progress than could be given by a dozen pages of description and
a hundred columns of figures.</p>

<p><em>Centre of Mileage and of Population.</em>&mdash;The space for notes
on the maps permits the bare mention of the meaning of the series
of stars in the 1889 map (<a href="#Page_433">page 433</a>), which mark the centres of
mileage and of population. It is well to state the manner of determining
the centres of mileage, that it may have its proper
bearing in any study of the subject into which the showing may
enter.</p>

<p>The locations are necessarily approximate. Each centre was
determined by selecting, on the proper map, a line running east
and west which seemed, to the eye, to nearly divide the mileage
into equal parts. The sum of the mileage of the States north,
was then compared with that of the States south of the line.
By this means the position of the line chosen by the eye was
corrected and the right parallel determined. The meridian dividing
the total mileage into equal parts was ascertained in like
manner. The point of intersection of the parallel and meridian is
marked in the map by a star, having the proper date printed to
the right of it.</p>

<p>The upper series of stars locates the centres of railway mileage,
and the lower series the centres of population, as given by
the returns of the census of 1880.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>The remarkable movement of the centre of mileage from 1850
to 1860 is easily understood when one turns to the maps of those
dates (<a href="#Page_430">page 430</a>) and locates the fields of activity. The wonderful
increase in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa gave the
Western impulse, while the growth in Tennessee and the States
south of it furnishes the principal explanation of the southerly
motion.</p>

<p>Although the study of this period is the most interesting of
the series, in the space passed over, yet each period has its points
of special interest, which the reader will easily solve by referring
to the proper maps on pages 430 to 433.</p>

<p><em>Railway Systems.</em>&mdash;The consolidation of separate lines under
central controlling interests has resulted in several "systems" of
great extent. Five such are mapped on pages 434 and 435. The
roads controlled by them are printed in broad lines, while all others
are printed in narrow lines. It needs but a glance to see whether
any of them has so far absorbed the roads of a given region as
to be able to control rates. The systems selected are believed to
be representative ones, and the mapping of a dozen others would
not tell the story any more plainly.</p>


<h3 class="fs70">TRUNK LINES COMPARED.</h3>

<p><em>Compared by Mileage.</em>&mdash;At present there are twenty-four corporations
reporting over one thousand miles of line each. A comparison
of these roads by mileage is profitless, as it furnishes no
just clew to their importance in point of business transacted.
Several of the shorter of these twenty-four lines largely exceed
some of the longer ones in the volume of business transacted. As
an example of the little value of comparison by mileage, the New
York Central &amp; Hudson River Road, with but 1,421 miles of line,
reports $63,132,920 receipts, while the Union Pacific, with 6,288
miles, reports but $19,898,817. Two of the twenty-four roads,
viz., the Southern Pacific Railroad (5,931 miles) and the Richmond,
West Point &amp; Terminal Railroad (6,869 miles) report
neither gross or net earnings. The remaining twenty-two report
both, and these reports furnish a satisfactory basis for study.</p>

<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;These maps are reductions of larger maps referred to in the titles.
This makes it possible to bring them within very convenient space for comparison,
and compensates for any indistinctness of lettering in the maps.</p>

<p>The railways of 1830 are pointed out by red arrows. Those of the other maps are
easily seen. The growth by decades is thus quickly located. In 1840, one continuous
line stretched from New York to Washington, D. C. Another considerable line
was that from Fredericksburg, Va., to Wilmington, N. C. In 1850, one could not go
by direct railway from New York to either Albany or Boston. In 1860, several direct
routes stretched from New York to far west of the Mississippi.</p>

<p><em><b>Note.</b></em>&mdash;In 1860 there was also in California,
a railway from Sacramento to Folsom City (22 miles).</p>

<p>In 1850 Chicago had one short road. In 1860 she had
several main lines, reaching hundreds of miles.&mdash;east,
west, north, and south. In 1850, Ohio, Indiana, and
Illinois were open fields. In 1860 they were crossed and
recrossed many times A similar change had taken place
in the south east. The 1860 map marks the condition at
the breaking out of the Civil War.&mdash;In 1870 there does not
appear to have been much change except in the north-west,
and the completion of the first Pacific line, and
yet there were 22,296 more miles than in 1860, nearly 700
miles more than the 1850&ndash;1860 growth, but being spread
over a wider area it does not appear as clearly. A little
careful study shows that many States had added considerably
to their mileage.&mdash;The names in the maps are
given mainly to mark terminal points.&mdash;While the map
locates the mileage, the chart at the left accurately
measures and compares it State by State.</p>

<p>Before turning to the 1880 map, let the eye go carefully
over the 1870 lines, that the comparison may be the more
properly made.</p>

<p>It is difficult to believe that so many roads could have been added in
ten years. All the 1870 area north of the Ohio River seems crowded at
nearly every point, and the network of advance westward, in the
States of Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, Nebraska, and Dakota,
is equally surprising. The growth in Texas was also very large, and
many new lines appear in other Southern States. The total increase
of the ten years was over forty thousand miles (40,374).</p>

<p>It would not seem possible that this rate of building could be longer
maintained, and yet the 1889 map shows a still greater growth. At
the close of 1888 (only eight years), the increase was 62,785 miles.</p>

<p>The figures in the two charts show that four States alone claim more
than one-fourth of the growth (Kansas, 5,354; Texas, 4,967; Dakota,
8,240 and Nebraska, 3,207 miles; total, 16,768 miles.) Six other States
(Iowa, Mich., Col., Minn., Wis., and Penn.) had each an increase of
over 2,000 miles.&mdash;The charts give Illinois the longest line from 1870,
but the position of Texas in the three charts seems to prophesy that
Illinois must soon yield. In 1860, Ohio led; in 1850, New York, and in
1840, Pennsylvania.&mdash;The upper series of stars in the 1880 map locate
the center of railway mileage. See <a href="#Page_427">page 427</a>, preceding.</p>

<p><b>Explanatory.</b>&mdash;The upper edge of the deep shade marks the
fluctuations of the average rate charged by the seven lines east of
Chicago.&mdash;The upper edge of the light shade marks the fluctuations
of the average rate charged by the six lines west of Chicago.&mdash;Each
particular road has a distinctive line, which makes it easy to trace
it among other lines.&mdash;All Western lines are accompanied by lines
of color, to distinguish them plainly from the Eastern lines, and to
make their relation to their own average more easily discovered.
The Boston and Albany is the only Eastern line whose rate places
it near the Western lines, but the absence of color prevents it from
being taken for a Western line, which it might otherwise be, especially
during the last three years, in its journey through and above
them all.&mdash;The C. B. &amp; Q. Road makes no report later than 1879.&mdash;The
Chicago and Alton report begins at 1874.</p>

<p><b>Explanatory.</b>&mdash;The diagram upon which the rates are charted (like all such
diagrams) is constructed of perpendicular and horizontal lines. Each line, and
each space between lines, has a particular meaning. The perpendicular spaces
represent years, indicated by the figures at the top of each space. The horizontal
spaces represent money values, each space representing .2c (two mills). Each
horizontal line represents a particular money value, marked by the figures at the
end of the line. Each black dot represents the average annual rate of some particular
road. For example, take the Boston and Albany Road. Starting with the
name and following the tracing line, the 1870 dot is found just below the 2.2c
(2 cents and 2 mills) line. This indicates that the average rate charged by that
road in 1870 was a trifle less than 2.2c. Following the line leading from the 1870
dot into the 1871 space, the 1871 dot is found a little below the center of the space
between the 2c line and the 2.2c line, indicating a rate of a little less than 2 cents
and 1 mill for 1871. The next year it is lower still. In this way the history of
any road is quickly traced.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Largest Receipts.</em>&mdash;A comparison on the basis of gross receipts
gives the best means of judging of the financial importance of the
several roads, for it measures the volume of business done. On
<a href="#Page_435">page 435</a> is given such a comparison of the fifteen roads (of the
twenty-two referred to above) reporting the largest gross receipts.</p>

<p><em>Largest Net Results.</em>&mdash;While the gross receipts measure the
volume of business they may not give any indication of net results.
A chart, immediately under that comparing gross receipts,
compares the net receipts of the fifteen roads (of the same twenty-two)
which report the highest per centages.</p>

<p>Of the ten reporting largest net results, seven are west of
Chicago. This fact, coupled with the desire of the great western
systems to possess new territory in advance of others, suggests a
reason for the large railway growth in that part of the country.</p>


<h3 class="fs70">FREIGHT TRAFFIC.</h3>

<p>The gross traffic receipts of the railways of the United States
are divided between freight and passenger business in very nearly
the proportion of three to one in favor of the freight traffic. For
this reason, and because the data are still more largely available on
the same side, the freight service receives herein the fuller treatment.</p>

<p><em>Reduction of Freight Rates.</em>&mdash;On the opposite page is a chart
delineating the fluctuations in freight rates since 1870. To one
not familiar with the subject the picture presented is a most remarkable
one. It looks as though the roads are all in a mad
scramble to see which can reach the bottom of the hill first. To
railway managers the picture is a painful reminder of a serious
struggle, the end of which no one can yet predict.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>The lines selected are representative lines of the east and west
divisions of the country, north of the Ohio River, where the great
number of competing roads has induced sharp competition.</p>

<p>The history of the <em>averages</em> is very clear, and it is easy to see
that they are steadily approaching common ground, for while in
1870 the eastern average marked almost exactly one cent six
mills, the western marked two cents four mills, a separation of
eight mills; in 1888 they recorded seven mills and a trifle over
nine mills, a separation of about one-quarter of the 1870 record.</p>

<p><em>Wheat Rates.</em>&mdash;The chart below repeats the lesson of the
larger chart as to reduction of rates. The persistency with
which water rates have kept below rail rates, emphasizes the
fact that wherever water-ways exist, they are stubborn competitors
for such freight traffic as will not suffer by the longer
time required for the journey.</p>

<div class="caption">Average Freight Rates

</div>

<p><em>The Freight Haul.</em>&mdash;It costs as much to load and unload a
train that hauls its freight ten miles as it does one that carries it a
thousand miles. In other words, the longer the haul the less the
proportional cost to the carriers. The great extension of long
lines westward in the last few years naturally raises the question
whether the average freight haul has increased. The largely diminished
rates suggest that probably producers have been led
thereby to ship both agricultural and manufactured products
greater distances to market. One or both of these conditions
may have operated favorably for some roads, but, plausible as
the theories seem, the facts prove that neither of them is supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
in a study of the average haul of the country. The available
figures permit us to go back only to 1882. Within that period
the little chart given herewith delineates
the fluctuations, but indicates no
permanency in either direction. It is
a matter of regret that in this, as in
many other studies, the history is not
available for earlier years, as the more
extended the view the better the judgment
of such questions becomes.</p>

<img src="images/i_439a.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Average Number of Miles each Ton of
Freight was Hauled.</div>
</div>

<p><em>Empty Freight Trains.</em>&mdash;One of the considerable items of expense
in the freight traffic is that of returning empty cars to their
point of starting. Just how large an item this is depends chiefly
upon the demands of the population at either end of the operating
line for the product of the population at the opposite end. Thus
the carriage of the great agricultural product of the West to feed
the denser population of the East, and for export to foreign countries,
may or may not be met by the demand of the western people
for the manufactures of the East and the imports from foreign
countries arriving at the eastern seaboard. It is scarcely probable
that any line, short or long, running east and west or north
and south, finds its traffic in opposite directions balanced.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_439b.jpg" width="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Percentage of East-Bound and West-Bound Freight carried by the Lake Shore
and Michigan Southern Railway Co.</div>
</div>

<p>An interesting study of this problem is presented in the accompanying
chart, the road selected for the illustration being one
of the large carriers between Chicago and Buffalo. The upper
chart-line marks the proportion of freight carried from west to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
east, while the lower line (at the top of the shaded part of the diagram)
marks the portion carried from east to west. It is readily
seen that in 1877 the west-bound freight was less than half as
much as the east-bound, for they stand 30.8 per cent, and 69.2 per
cent., respectively; and in 1878 the difference is still greater. From
that year, however, there has been great improvement, so that
now it would appear that there is on that road a much diminished
need for hauling empty cars. The history of the Pennsylvania
Road is similar to that shown in the chart, but the ratios have not
come so nearly together. That of the New York Central &amp;
Hudson River Road shows very little change in the ratios since
1870, and all the time both these roads report a very large excess
of east-bound freight.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_440.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Profit per Ton per Mile.</div>
</div>

<p><em>Freight Profits.</em>&mdash;The change in rates are of great moment to
the producer; that of profits is the important one to the carrier.
No matter how great the reduction of rates, if the reduction of expense
is as great, the profits are not disturbed. This question
can be studied best by examining the figures which measure the
actual profits. But few corporations furnish such figures, and the
two whose history is delineated on the accompanying chart are
among those giving the most readily available data. It will be
seen that the reduction of profits is no less remarkable than the reduction
of rates, which shows that the reduction of rates has far
exceeded that of expense of carriage; for, had the reduction of expenses
kept pace with that of rates, the profits would have remained
level. As it is, the reduction of profits in the history of these roads,
as shown, is from about six mills per ton per mile in 1870, to about
two mills in 1888. These two roads are probably good representatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
of the experience of the general freight service of all railways
north of the Ohio River. If so, the prospect of the future
of freight traffic is not cheerful.</p>


<h3 class="fs70">PASSENGER TRAFFIC.</h3>

<p>The study of passenger traffic is less satisfactory than that of
freight traffic. Fewer lines furnish a history of their passenger
rates, and ordinarily those histories cover shorter periods. The
study is therefore confined to narrower limits and its lessons are
necessarily less conclusive.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_441.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Passenger Rates per Mile.</div>
</div>

<p><em>Passenger Rates.</em>&mdash;Below is given a chart interpreting the available
data of six representative lines. The first lesson impressed is
that no such reduction marks the history of passenger rates as is
shown in freight rates, although the general trend of the chart-lines
is plainly downward. The line indicating the average rate for all
the roads in the country (marked U. S. in the chart) shows a reduction
of over one-fourth of a cent per passenger per mile since
1882.</p>

<p>Certain features of this chart attract special attention. The reduction
of rates by the Pennsylvania, and the New York Central
&amp; Hudson River roads in 1876, and that by the same roads in
1885, are suggestive. Equally noticeable are the reductions of
the Illinois Central in 1871, 1872, 1880, and 1888.</p>

<p>This chart would seem to indicate that competition has not
operated as sharply on passenger as on freight traffic.</p>

<p><em>Passenger Travel.</em>&mdash;The average distance that passengers ride
is not as important an element of railway business as is the average<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
freight haul, for the passengers load and unload themselves; so
that, whether they ride few or many miles, the cost of loading and
unloading is neither increased nor diminished. On the contrary, if
a thousand tons of freight, once loaded, is to be hauled one hundred
miles instead of fifty, the proportional cost of loading and unloading
is reduced one-half.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_442a.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Average Number of Miles each Passenger
was Carried.</div>
</div>

<p>Still, the average distance passengers ride is important; for, if
the number of passengers remains the same and their ride is shorter,
the receipts are diminished. The returns show that while the
number of passengers has increased since 1882 about fifty-six per
cent., the total miles travelled have not increased quite fifty per
cent., marking a falling off in the average number of miles each
passenger rode. The reduction is
graphically shown in the little chart
given herewith. This result is no
doubt largely due to the great increase
of suburban travel which has
developed about our large cities within
the past few years.</p>

<p>It is necessary to state, however,
that the figures embraced in this study do not include the traffic of
the elevated roads of New York and Brooklyn.</p>

<p><em>Passenger Profits.</em>&mdash;Again a marked difference between freight
and passenger traffic appears in comparing the chart given below
with the corresponding chart on <a href="#Page_440">page 440</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_442b.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Profit per Passenger per Mile.</div>
</div>

<p>The study covers the history of the same roads in each case.
The history of freight profits shows a persistent falling off, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
in the nineteen years amounts to four mills per ton per mile, a loss
of two-thirds of the six mills of 1870. The history delineated on
this chart shows the average profit of the two roads to be almost
exactly at the same point that it was in 1870, while the profits for
most of the intervening years have been much greater.</p>

<p>Were this the record of the freight traffic, it would be much
more gratifying to the managers of the roads, for the New York
Central &amp; Hudson River Railway receives about twice as much,
and the Pennsylvania Railway receives four times as much, from
freights as from passengers. Attention is invited to the opposite
results of the same policy on these two roads in 1876. The chart
of passenger rates on <a href="#Page_441">page 441</a> marks a decided reduction of rates
by the Pennsylvania Road, and a slight reduction by the New York
Central &amp; Hudson River Road. The chart of profits records an
increase for the former and a decrease for the latter. This year
(1876) is the date of the Centennial World's Fair at Philadelphia.
The Pennsylvania Road had an enormous increase of passenger
traffic (double that of the following year), a record which it did
not equal until 1887. The New York Central &amp; Hudson River
Road had but a slightly increased traffic, the record of which it
passed in 1881.</p>


<h3 class="fs70">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.</h3>

<p><em>Dividends.</em>&mdash;While many readers are probably not holders of
railway stocks, yet a look at the dividends received by those who
are will not be without interest. The little chart given below tells
an interesting, although a not over-attractive story.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_443.jpg" width="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Average Dividend Paid on Total Capital Stock.</div>
</div>

<p>It shows that, comparing the aggregate of all the railroad
stocks of the country with the aggregate of all dividends paid,
the holders of stock realized an average of 3.03% on their investment
in 1876. In 1878 it had fallen to less than 2½%. From that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
date to 1885 the record makes a curve ending just above 2%. A
slight rally is indicated for 1886 and 1887, but 1888 carries it down
to 1.81%. The stock of many roads has paid no dividend whatever
these later years, and the lines whose stock proves a good
investment at par are very few.</p>

<div class="caption">Net Earnings and Mileage Built.</div>

<p><em>Net Earnings per Mile.</em>&mdash;Although the studies of the financial
question already made undoubtedly point out the true drift of
railway business, yet one more comparison is worth making, both
for its bearing on the question of profits and the study of the influence
of profits on railway building. The upper one of the two
charts given herewith is the record of net earnings per mile of
road in operation, and is based on the reported net earnings less
the interest-charge. It therefore shows the average number of
dollars each mile had earned, after paying all expenses and the interest
on its debt. This money, then, is the clear amount each
mile could apply each year to pay the principal of its debt and
the dividends on its capital stock, or to use for improvements, such
as rolling stock, stations, better road-bed, new rails, or any other
betterments which might seem advisable.</p>

<p>In 1876 this sum was $1,264; in 1880 it was $1,798, since
which time it has suffered a serious decline, until in 1888 it was
only $650. It is the story of the previous studies repeated, and
needs no further reiteration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Railway Building.</em>&mdash;The larger chart given on <a href="#Page_429">page 429</a>,
gives the history of railway building from 1831 to 1888. The
lower chart of the two given together on <a href="#Page_444">page 444</a>, repeats the
annual record from 1876, for the purpose of studying the influence
of profits on the progress of building. The net earnings
per mile show a reduction in 1877. The following year
shows an increase of earnings, and the building responded somewhat
feebly the same year. The next two years (1879 and 1880)
show great gains in net earnings, and the impetus given thereby
to building, carries its increase steadily forward even two years
beyond the turning-point of the earnings. The decline is then
mutual to 1885. In 1886 the advance in earnings was responded
to by such a remarkable increase in building that the stimulus
is to be sought for partly outside of the increase of earnings,
and is undoubtedly found in the desire to occupy the newly
opening fields of western settlement; for the records mark unparalleled
activity among the great trunk lines of the West in
pushing their advances in Dakota, Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado,
in 1886 and 1887. This is graphically shown in the
map of 1889, when compared with that of 1880 (pages 432 and
433).</p>

<p><em>Ratios of Increase.</em>&mdash;It is difficult to obtain a just impression of
values when expressed by figures alone. It is easy when these
values are expressed in lines or colors. The greater difficulties
come in the effort to compare values expressed in differing terms.
To read that the increase of population was 23,400,000 from
1870 to 1888; and that of railway mileage was 62,785 miles; and
that of freight traffic was nearly 30,000,000,000 tons, in the same
period, and then to attempt the comparison of increase without
further aid, is a hopeless task.</p>

<p>As a study of financial economy the comparison is worth making,
for evidence of the over-development of an industry or a financial
interest, rightly considered, may prevent suicidal development.
The chart given on the next page makes the comparison easy.
The actual increase in each instance is reduced to percentages, and
the several chart-lines measure the progress. The increase of
population is estimated on the basis of 62,000,000 persons in 1888.
(So far as the lesson conveyed by the chart is concerned, the estimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
might as well have been 60,000,000, the variation in the location
of the line would be trifling.)</p>

<p>It appears, then, that railway mileage has increased nearly two
hundred per cent. and that the rate of increase of freight traffic
(as measured by ton-miles<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>) has been enormously larger, considering
the history of the thirteen trunk lines as indicative of the
whole. It further appears that the freight traffic of the West has
developed much more rapidly than that of the East, during the
last eight years.</p>

<p><em>Construction and Maintenance.</em>&mdash;The tabulated statistics of
these subjects are not of special interest, as the annual variation of
cost is slight. In both these elements the wage-question is so
large a factor that a comparative level is maintained from year to
year. The available figures touching these subjects are few. The
first table on the opposite page gives the average cost of construction
per mile of the <em>total mileage of the country</em>; and the cost of
maintenance per mile as reported by the New York, Lake Erie
&amp; Western Road. The second table furnishes interesting <em>details</em>
of the cost of maintenance.</p>

<p><em>Employees.</em>&mdash;This item is also one touching which railways
make few reports. The New York Central &amp; Hudson River Road
reports as follows: "Average number of employees, 20,659, being
at the rate of 14.54 per mile of road worked; aggregate wages,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
$12,460,708.89, or $603.16 each. Payments in wages equalled
50.60 per cent. of the total working expenses, against 51.90 per
cent. in 1886&ndash;87." Reckoning that each employee's wages supports
an average of three persons, we have a total of 61,977 persons
clothed, housed, and fed by this one corporation.</p>

the rolling stock of the country is given on <a href="#Page_148">page 148</a>; it is therefore

grasp the immensity of the financial interest expressed in the statement,
that the combined capital invested in the railways of the
United States is $9,369,398,954. No more can it comprehend
that this vast aggregate has been the growth of about fifty years
in a single interest, in a single country.</p>

<p>The first date in the table marks the close of the first century
of our national life. Since that time the investment has more than
doubled; an increase of nearly five billion dollars in twelve years&mdash;an
average of over four hundred million dollars per year. More
exactly expressed, this means $1,118,906 per day, or $46,621 for
every hour, day and night, during the first twelve years of our
second century.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that no other financial interest shows a total of
such wonderful magnitude. And with greater emphasis may it
be said, that the finances of the world, record, in all the ages, to
the present day, no such astounding increase of investment.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
the text and consultation of external sources.</p>

<p>Basic fractions are displayed as ½ ¼ ¾; other fraction are shown in
the form <sup>a</sup>/<sub>b</sub> as <sup>1</sup>/<sub>117</sub> or 39<sup>2</sup>/<sub>10</sub> for example.</p>

<p>A large dense table spanning two pages in the original book (<a href="#Page_158">page 158
and 159</a>) has been split into 4 parts, with column #1 (engine number)
being repeated in each part. The vertical column headings have been
replaced by a key, A B etc, with an explanation of the keys at the
beginning of each part. Some cell values were unclear in the scanned
image and a best guess of the digit has been made.</p>

<p>Another large table at <a href="#Page_447">page 447</a> has been split into 2 parts.</p>

<p>In several tables with dollar.cent values the decimal point is faint
or missing. For consistency the decimal point has been inserted in
all cases.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_370">Footnote #31</a> had no anchor; this has been added in the chapter title.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
